      "BTS members RM, Jin, V, and Jungkook featured in a new Bangtan Bomb video from last year when they performed at The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The video was dropped on Bangtan TV's YouTube channel on Wednesday. It showed the members recording their dance performances to their tracks Butter and Dynamite for the show. Titled BTS’s Chaotic Break Time, the video started with Jungkook giving an update about the members. \"We just finished Dynamite and Butter. We're recording it but the song (Butter) hasn't been released yet. It hasn't hit me yet. Until it's really released we'll keep preparing and practising whenever we have time.\" As Jungkook spoke, V stood behind him giving directions to Jin on what to say on camera. At first, Jin spoke about his appearance in the song, \"It's not that I opened the performance fancy. I just stood up and walked. If that looked fancy all I could say is that my face was fancy.\" Jin then burst out laughing and said, \"Our members are listening to this through the mic so it's a bit embarrassing.\" While talking, Jin kept on shifting his glances at the camera and V. He then showed a finger heart revealing that V asked him to do so. Speaking about V, Jin said, \"He said to say something to the camera. He told me to say ‘Please look forward to it’.\" As V continued giving instructions on the mic set, Jin obediently repeated it in the camera, \"He said he loves ARMY. He said he can't wait to hold a concert.\" Following this, RM became the next member to feature in the clip. As soon as he showed up, Jin and V joined him and they started interrupting each other's interviews. RM started with, \"Hello. Welcome to the first day of our Butter promotion. I sincerely...\" However, he was cut off by V saying, \"You have nose hair.\" As RM moved away, V said in the camera, \"Hello ARMY, I'm Kin Taehyung.\" Here Jin said, \"You have mouth hair.\" V walked away and Jin said, \"Hello everyone. This is Jin.\" But V interrupted saying, \"You have armpit hair.\" As he started talking facing the camera, RM came and said, \"You have eye hair.\" Smiling at the camera, RM said, \"It's s nice to meet you guys.\" As V walked into the frame asking RM, \"You got neck hair?\", Jin told the group leader, \"You look handsome today.\" Finally, Jin was able to say, \"Hello. I'm Jin. What we're doing today is recording Butter. It's very awkward since no one's pushing their way in. Fighting!\" Next on V's target was Jungkook. As the youngest member said, \"We'll continue to show you good performances\" V pushed him out of the frame saying, \"Outta my way.\" As the video ended, V said, \"Everyone, please look forward to it.\" Last year, BTS members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook had to participate in a skit for The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Butter released in May last year and clinched the top spot of the Billboard Hot 100 for nine consecutive weeks. The song also broke several records including Most Viewers for the Premiere of a Music Video on YouTube, Most Viewers for the Premiere of a Video on YouTube, Most-viewed YouTube Music Video in 24 hours by a K-pop group and Most Viewed YouTube Music Video in 24 hours.\n",

He danced to BTS' song Dynamite (Tropical Remix) with a complete new choreography. After the festival, J-Hope and Jimin posed for pictures together. The official Twitter handle of BTS shared a series of pictures from the event. Speaking to the audience at the festival, J-Hope said, \"I pour my heart and soul into my music. Even if we speak different languages, I hope you listen to my story.\" BTS fandom ARMY took to Twitter and showered love on J-Hope for his performance. A fan wrote, \"Goosebumps. Thank you J-Hope.\" \"J-Hope owned it. I'm just at home but I felt like I attended personally I'm sweating, screaming,\" said another fan. \"You have just witnessed the legendary artist Jung Hoseok make history. #HOBIPALOOZA,\" tweeted another fan. After his electrifying performance, J-Hope held a live session on V Live which was also joined by Jimin. Speaking to the fans, J-Hope said, \"The process of this album that began from desire and childish ambitiousness, we're moving magnificently towards the finale of one of the processes. Through this album, all the schedules became my blood and flesh (part of me) and while looking at you all and our ARMY & the public while (performing in) Lollapalooza today, once again I think another determination and definite faith has formed.\" Speaking about Jimin, J-Hope said, \"Since the moment he came, I've had the smile flower bloomed on me. I was really into the process as you felt when you came here, it was a world of darkness, you came and became my light. You entered like 'J-Hope-the light'.\" Jimin complimented J-Hope's performance and dedication. \"He really has been working so hard.. like not eating at the time, even losing weight, working in the absolute dark— like even I like dark places but it was really too dark? Did you guys see the dynamite dance? I feel like we should change the main choreography.\" On his time on stage at the event, J-Hope said, \"Honestly it was nine songs originally but it became 10. I think the run time went over one hour.\" Jimin replied, \"We couldn't tell, it went by quickly\" and J-Hope added, \"Maybe cause I didn't say endments, it went by quickly.\" As the live ended, Jimin told ARMY that J-Hope 'didn't even sleep properly in anticipation and the rapper replied, \"I couldn't sleep more than three hours.\" He signed off by saying, “Also feeling a little abashed to say this to myself but I want to tell myself that I'm proud for overcoming this moment.”\n",
      "BLACKPINK members are now busy promoting their album Pink Venom. They are in the US. The girls went on the Jimmy Kimmel show where they did a live performance of the song. It seems Rose outdid herself with her moves and amazing vocals. Now, the host said that 'kids' were super excited to see BLACKPINK on the Kimmel stage. This has not gone down well with K-Pop fans. It is a known fact that the popular groups have fans across age groups and ethnicities. Some time back, James Corden referred to BTS fans as 15-year-old fangirls and ARMY did not take it lightly at all. In fact, the host apologized to RM aka Kim Namjoon when they came on the show during the LA Concert promotions Now, Kim Jisoo had to miss the 2022 Seoul Drama Awards to be present for the promotions of Pink Venom. She was awarded the Best Actress for Snowdrop. Blinks and solo fans of Jisoo are upset that she had to miss out because of Jimmy Kimmel. Some have even termed the performance as boring. They feel YG Entertainment should have done better with the promotions of Pink Venom. Snowdrop saw a heartfelt performance from Kim Jisoo. This was her acting debut Jisoo's vocals have also got praise in the Blackpink comeback. The singer is seen as the eldest sister of the group, and has been their emotional anchor. Kim Jisoo won at the fan voted event. Even Kim Seon-Ho who is world famous for his poignant acting in Hometown Cha Cha won an award\n",
      "After the performance, BTS interacted with the drummer-rapper who said that their track Yet To Come reminds him of church and called it 'fantastic'. Anderson also spoke a few words in Korean. He also revealed, \"It was my son because he's a big fan, he made me a fan. I've been obsessed, I've been ARMY ever since.\" They also spoke about attending each other's concerts and complimented them. After the rapper left, the members spoke about their 'best moments so far' in their careers. J-Hope said that it was the day BTS was born, June 13, 2013, while Jimin recalled it as the day when BTS had their solo concert in 2014. Suga said for him, it was BTS' showcase day on June 12, 2013, \"I still remember the basement floor at the King Kong building, Ilchi Art Hall.\" RM said that when BTS had their first concert at the Olympic Gymnastic Arena, it was his 'best moment'. V said, \"For me, it was those days when Jungkook would cry if I asked, 'Are you crying?' That was the best moment for me.\" The other members teased him. Jungkook recalled that the day he joined BTS was his 'best moment'. \"I believe BTS wouldn't exist without me. I'm sorry that was a joke,\" he said. Jin credited all the moments so far as his 'best moment'. BTS members next spoke about their journey since Covid-19 in 2020 during which 'a lot of things changed' for them and the ARMY. RM said, \"Most of the things we've done since 2020 weren't planned in advance. None of it was planned.\" Suga added, \"Nothing went as planned.\" RM continued, \"As we went on we were sometimes a little afraid and unsure if we were on the right path. We've also had growing reservations about what was the right answer.\" Jimin said, \"We thought the pandemic would be over soon...but none of us thought that it would take more than two years.\" Suga said, \"We're like 'Let's give it three months. We'll be able to have a concert in three months'.\" Jungkook added that it was then the group came out with their song Dynamite as it was their 'way of braving the Covid-19 pandemic'. They also spoke about their album BE, songs Butter and Permission to Dance and their concerts. Speaking about Proof, V said, \"If you look closely many of our unreleased songs are included in this album. We took those songs as a chance to reminisce on when they were recorded. We also wanted to wrap up our first chapter, that's why we created our album.\" Suga added, \"When I grow interested in an artist, it's hard to listen to all their albums. This album is like the essence. Once you follow this guide, you'll get a rough idea of who BTS is. It's like a textbook or a guidebook you can show to beginners.\" Last week BTS released Proof via BigHit Music. The album, comprising three discs, is a look back on the group's journey in the last near decade. The songs in the album comprise the members' personal selections from their old tracks. It is a gift to ARMY and also features a brand-new single Yet to Come (The Most Beautiful Moment), Run BTS, and For Youth.\n",
      "During the episode, the members took a trip down memory lane as they visited their dorms, spoke about eating icecreams, visiting a particular restaurant and taking walks near their dorm. They also recalled the famous dumpling incident (involving a heated argument between Jimin and V) and the banana incident (when Jungkook noticed fruits disappearing from the fruit basket ARMY gave him. At that time, Jungkook argued saying it was his and J-Hope got angry, threw a banana at him and said, 'You eat it all'). While taking a walk near their dorm, RM recalled how the members walked on the street every day during the initial days of their career. He also said how he and V got caught while having ice cream. Recalling the exact spot, RM said, “I got caught exactly around here. I took the ice cream cone and stuffed it in my pocket. He (the person) asked where we were going, so we just said, 'Back to our dorm'. In the end, the ice cream melted in my pocket, but I didn't want to waste it. So I took it off and ate it again.” While RM and Jimin took a walk, Jin and V feasted on Jajangmyeon (Korean noodle dish). Suga sat in his car outside the restaurant that the members frequented earlier. The members tried to figure out each other's locations as they travelled in their cars around the city. By round two, Jungkook joined RM, Jin, Jimin, and V. Suga also met J-Hope near their old dorm and screamed 'my friend' from his car. All the members met at the Jamwon Han River Park and hugged each other. For a few moments, they forgot about filming and huddled together asking each other where they first went. The crew had to interrupt asking them to face the camera. In the last round, the members were given the keyword, ARMY. Though they were together, they could not discuss which place they would go to separately. RM kept hinting to J-Hope, \"We can go back to a place we've been already.\" He suggested the Olympic Stadium. All the members were seen heading to the venue except V who chose the first showcase venue of BTS. He said, \"I'll ask ARMY if it should be the first concert or first showcase.\" However, he got shy and couldn't ask anyone despite making several attempts in Garosu-gil. The video ended with all of them meeting for lunch during which the members discussed on what to do next. RM suggested 'getting middle-aged men from just around neighbourhood and playing 7-7 volleyball'. Jungkook suggested they learn Sepak takraw, a game, Jin asked about farming, and Suga came up with the idea of racing. Jimin said, \" I want to try pole dancing too.\" RM added, \"That suits you though.\" The video ended with V goofily saying, \"Run BTS will continue running.\"\n",
      "It was recently that BTS members launched their special clothing line called Artist Made Collection. The septet - RM, Jin, Jungkook, Jimin, V, Suga and J-Hope designed the clothes on their own and they even turned models to promote each other's designs. Now, BTS' longtime manager Hobum Song was sported wearing pajamas designed by Jin. Hobum Song and Jin are said to have a special connect as they are said to be each other's favourite. If one can recalls, Jin had used Hobum Song's shoulders to hide when went all shy as he recieved praises. The manager took to his Instagram account to share pictures wearing the pajamas and ARMY was instantly reminded of Hobum Song and Jin's bond The Bangtan Boys had even attended the manager's wedding and performed on their song DNA. In Hobum Song's wedding album, there is a picture of BTS boys enjoying themselves to the fullest\n",

      "BTS ARMY, Run BTS is finally back and the Tuesdays won't ever be so dull as they had been in the past 10 months. The newest episode of Run BTS dropped on Weverse, VLIVE and YouTube dropped a couple of hours ago. Run BTS is officially back! Since we still have to wait for another Tuesday for the continuation episode of Run BTS, we thought of bringing back some of the funniest and most entertaining episodes for y'all to binge-watch in your free time, meanwhile In this Run BTS episodes, BTS members – RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook pick their Manito and then play the game of jumping into the photo zone and axing expressions based on the given keywords. In the second episode of BTS X Manito, they play the game of Bingo based on food items on their bingo chart. The members have to act out the food items and the others have to guess the answer and tick off the list. These two are by far the most hilarious episodes of Run BTS In this episode of Run BTS, we saw the epic whisper challenge game where Jin aka Kim Seokjin showcased his amazing telepathic abilities and Jimin introduced us to La Chi Mo La La Not that the VR game part 1 is not that fun but the Part 2 of VR games played by the Bangtan Boys was more fun. J-Hope was the funniest especially when she dropped from the high rise. Taetae's swag to Jungkook being the pro at playing games was a sight for ARMYs BTS ARMY, if you want to have a good laugh while watching Run BTS episodes these two are great for laughter packs. It was in the second episode of Summer Outing that the boys had to fight with Jungkook and he still won the game. Jungkook is quite agile The Bangtan Boys - RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook played some fun games whilst in Pajamas. The most fun part was chimchim aka Park Jimin's sketches on socks to guess the word by drawing. Guess who was the artist of the episode at that time? In this episode, the Bangtan Boys played games that they played in the past. Taehyung's memory power left the members speechless. The Rapline and the vocal line had been divided into two groups and the Rap line was at their hilarious best. The second episode also saw the return of the photo booth In these two episodes of Run BTS, we saw the Bangtan Boys getting missions. Hidden between them was a spy. The missions were to click photos with the rest of the members based on certain themes. However, when the soy was revealed, the Bangtan Boys felt the shock of their lives The 77-minute Debate episodes are the funniest of the lot. The boys were divided into two teams and had to debate about foods and everything under the sun which makes them the goofiest. The main factor here is the water shower based on the banned word. Jungkook, Jimin and other Bangtan Boys when learned the banned words they used them to trouble the judge in the centre. It was laughter riots of the two episodes Meanwhile, the latest episode of Run BTS featured the Bangtan Boys – RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook playing the game of telepathy and revealing how much they still know about each others' thoughts and ways of doing things\n",

Hobi getting the answers wrong and adding to the woes of the members was a sight to see. Hobi being confused while answering the questions was a sight that the ARMYs would have missed in the last 10 years BTS leader RM aka Kim Namjoon while guessing the gestures during the telepathy game goofed up a lot. The BTS members were asked to guess the expressions and act them out based on the situation given. Suga goofed up too but not as much as RM So, when it was the time for the third game wherein they had to guess the destination using a few words presented as clues. Suga took off to Han River whereas J-Hope went to Jamsil Stadium and Jungkook took off to Lotte World. They hoped that at least one of the members would get the same answer as them. Well, they did but their route took them to a different location Towards the end of the Run BTS episode, we will see Jin, Jimin, RM and Taehyung having stronger telepathy. In their game of destination telepathy, the members were given clues and had to go to a destination they'd feel resonated with the clues. Jin, Jimin, RM and Taehyung reached their old dorm one after another and it was a heartening sight for the ARMYs. Jin, Jimin and Taetae hugged too, marvelling at their telepathic powers.

      "The video started with Suga practising the choreography of That That. After teaching the rapper a few steps, the choreographers said that he 'learns fast'. Suga laughed and said, \"Then we can work on the details. I'm not too confident. I just memorise quickly.\" After learning some more dance steps, Suga said laughing, \"I knew it. I knew it wouldn't be easy. I was practising for the concert.\" At one point during their practice, Suga got curious and asked the choreographer, \"Are you a leftie? We normally start with the right hand. You started everything with the left hand. So I thought you were a leftie.\" As the video continued, Suga practised and said, \"If I think about something else for a moment. I miss it.\" One of the choreographers again told Suga that 'he's learning fast'. The rapper laughed and said, \"I'm an idol after all,\" to which they all laughed and agreed. Suga also practised with PSY and the entire team of That That. During their break, Suga asked PSY, \"Don't you shoot part by part?\" PSY replied, \"You don't think I have the stamina?\" As PSY teased Suga, the latter laughed. As the video ended, Suga said, \"It's harder than our recent choreography. I'm so exhausted. The choreography I didn't think it'd be this hard. I should do well tomorrow.\" Suga, PSY and their team seemingly filmed the music video of That That the next day. That That celebrates the end of the Covid-19 pandemic, and things going back to normal. In the song, both Suga and PSY featured in cowboy outfits in the middle of a desert. That That is part of PSY's latest album PSY 9th. Meanwhile, BTS members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook are awaiting the release of their upcoming anthology album Proof.

      "BTS members Jimin and V featured in a new Bangtan Bomb video. The clip, which was released on Tuesday on Bangtan TV's YouTube channel, showed them recall how they interacted with fans on camera after they debuted with RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope and Jungkook in 2013. The video started with BTS' Jimin and V warming up using a chair before shooting for their track Butter last year. As Jimin lifted the chair over his head, V told him, \"You've to straighten your arms.\" He replied, \"I can't go any higher because of the jacket. Here's the limit (as he showed how far he can lift the chair above him).\" As their staff worked around them, they continued their exercise smiling. Next, Jimin came to the camera as he covered nearly the entire lens. He said, \"Now we only have one last shooting left.\" V peered over his shoulder and asked what he was doing and if he was having fun. Jimin responded by laughing, \"It's what we used to do when we debuted. We used to do this a lot when we debuted. We'd get greedy and want to show more for our fans.\" Jimin then added, \"We are talking now.\" Pointing at V, he said, \"He used to do this a lot.\" V added, \"It's true that I used to say things like that.\" The video ended with Jimin and V talking in 'sim' language, as the caption read, all the while laughing and pulling each other's legs. All the BTS members, who are on an 'extended period of rest', are gearing up for their upcoming concerts in Seoul next month. This will be BTS' first show for th live audience in Seoul since the coronavirus pandemic began. The concerts, Permission to Dance on Stage-Seoul, will take place at Seoul's Olympic Stadium on March 10, 12 and 13, and will also be live-streamed, the group's agency Bit Hit Music had said. Their last concert for South Korean fans was in October 2019, a couple of months before the coronavirus began. As the pandemic spread in 2020, the band postponed and then called off their international tour involving nearly 40 concerts. They held some online shows instead. BTS debuted in 2013 and have produced many songs over the years. In November last year, they created history by becoming the first Asian artists to win the top prize at the American Music Awards. They played their first in-person concerts since the onset of the pandemic in November, in Los Angles. The pandemic also affected a few members--RM, Jin, Suga, Jimin and V, as they contracted the coronavirus. However, all of them have fully recovered.\n",
      "Recently, Jungkook along with the other group members RM, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, and V held a live session on V Live. However, Jin wasn't present with them as he underwent surgery for his finger injury. During the live, a fan asked, \"What happened to Jungkook’s shirt during Fake Love?\" At this, Suga asked if the button really popped off and Jungkook replied, as translated by Twitter user @btsbaragi_jk, \"It got unbuttoned.\" The other members started teasing him. Suga asked, \"You didn’t do that on purpose?\" Jimin said, \"You seemed to be continuously laughing and smiling as you performed.\" RM said, \"I saw him before we went in (on stage) and he was pulling it off (at the thread) a lot.\" Jungkook said, \"The reason I laughed is because I buttoned it up once but it got undone again so I was dumbfounded.\" Suga reminded RM that previously he had once accidentally ripped off Jungkook's buttons. To this Jungkook, added, \"I did give it a thought. Since its already unbuttoned, should I unbutton another one? Should I just completely unbutton it?’\" V chimed in saying, \"I think it would be nice if you performed by taking it off one day.\" Jungkook replied, \"No, not for me. I’m not ready yet.\" Jimin added, \"As far as I know, at the time, the fans couldn’t hold back their cheers and a sound came out of their mouths.\" He was speaking of the time during the concert when Jungkook's blazer got unbuttoned. Suga asked Jungkook, \"I heard you went in after putting in on oil on day three.\" While RM and J-Hope laughed, Jungkook said, \"But I always do that since I have to show my abs. Always have to be prepared.\" Speaking about Jin, Suga said that he is taking rest and Jimin added that he is recovering well. RM said, \"Don't worry too much, you guys, he said he's okay. The surgery was short and he's okay honestly.\" The live saw Jin's representative, BT21 character RJ's soft toy. Referring to it, Jungkook said, \"That's why this friend came (RJ). Jimin said, \"Jin hyung (brother) told us to convey his greeting to you guys. We saw him today\" and RM added, \"On seeing him, he was doing fine.\" Next, their conversation steered towards their Instagram accounts. Suga asked J-Hope if he has deleted all his Instagram photos. J-Hope replied, \"No. I moved a couple over to archive. I didn't delete it. I moved them to the archive. Turns out you can bring them back later. I searched about it.\" Jimin also spoke on why he doesn't share posts on Instagram regularly. He said, \"With Instagram, I can’t go on it because I’m scared I might press something wrong.\" As RM urged him to share posts he said he will. The members concluded the session by saying that they will hold another live in Las Vegas. BTS will perform in Las Vegas' Allegiant Stadium on April 8, April 9, April 15, and April 16.\n",
      "Jay Park took to his Instagram account on Tuesday to share pictures from his recent meeting with Jungkook, and showered the K-pop star with praises. The first picture was a selfie in which Jungkook pouted as he kept his arm around Jay Park, who flashed a huge smile. In the second picture, both of them posed against a music workstation. Sharing the pictures, Jay wrote, “Even though he’s at the top, he has a growth mindset and he’s humble. What a stud… Plus he’s good at boxing… After I met Jk I can definitely see why they get so much love. Humble, [ambitious] and talented.\" Jungkook shared the post on his Instagram Stories. The post soon received several comments from fans asking if Jungkook is planning to collaborate with the American rapper, who was previously a part of K-pop group 2PM. Many fans commented \"OMG,\" with one writing, \"Are they making music together?? Collab?\" Another commented, \"Right now I will start praying that they make a song together, out of Jungkook's comfort zone, something Jay Park style.\" However, a large section of ARMY was not happy about the meeting and took to Twitter to say that they cannot forgive Jay Park. The Seattle-based rapper had risen to fame as the leader of the South Korean boy band 2PM in 2008. But he left the band and South Korea and returned home the next year following a major controversy when the comments he wrote about Korea in 2005 as a teenager were publicised by the Korean media. In addition, he had also previously criticised BTS in several tweets. He wrote in one such tweet in 2018, “Two ppl on the plane asked me if I was part of BTS … lol I need to get my weight up.\" ARMY cited these tweets as they suggested that Jungkook is posing with him because he is being held hostage. \"Free Jungkook of Jay Park,\" one wrote, while another commented, \"Free Jungkook. he only did what he had to do he didn’t mean it #jkheldhostage #jkhostagesituation.\" A third one wrote, \"Jungkook prolly the nicest person on earth i know damn well that mf had a gun on the other side forcing him to take a selfie ! praying jungkook got home safely without finding out he lost his wallet #freejungkook.\" Another commented, \"Jay Park the biggest hypocrite ever because he acted like he didn't shade BTS and ARMYS in the past but now he's all smiling and acting like a saint.\" Meanwhile, BTS members Jungkook, Jin, Jimin, J-Hope, Suga, and V have returned to South Korea after their Permission to Dance concert in Las Vegas. Group leader RM was not spotted with them during their arrival at Seoul airport on Tuesday.\n",
      "The video started with Jimin sitting in his car on his way to the shop. He said, \"I've always wanted to go to a workshop and make jewellery. I've always wanted to try it. You all know that I like jewellery. So I thought I could go and make some simple bracelets for today. So that's where I'm going right now.\" He also said, \"I got my wisdom tooth pulled out. After I got my wisdom tooth out I ate more and gained weight. I'm about 64.7 kg right now. I'm gonna make jewellery and go on a diet.\" At the workshop, Jimin worked on making the jewellery. However, he broke the blade of the saw, he was working with, twice. He said, \"I'm so sorry. I just broke the last one and broke it again. I'm very sorry.\" After getting the second replacement of the blade Jimin said, \"Please last this time.\" After sawing, Jimin filed the metal and continued with the process to make the bracelet. As he hammered a metal piece, he asked the people, \"Don't I look like an employee here? Are you here to pick up a project? What if I become your best apprentice?\" Jimin continued working on the jewellery and said, \"It feels so exciting. This is fun. So much effort goes into this.\" Jimin, after finishing making the bracelets, said, \"I'll wear one on each wrist. It went faster than I expected.\" Wearing them he showed it to the camera and said, \"These are the nice bracelets I made. I'm so satisfied and had so much fun. The hammering was especially fun for me. The shaping process was fun. The sawing part was the hardest. It was so fun. If ARMY wants to try this kind of hobby too or if you want to make something valuable for yourself in a quiet place, it'll be fun to go to a workshop like this.\" Bangtan TV has been sharing videos featuring the vlogs of BTS members every week. So far V shared his vlog where he had meals with his crew, played golf and travelled around the city. In J-Hope's vlog, he gave a glimpse of the shooting of his latest album, Jack in the Box. The vlogs of RM, Jin, Suga, and Jungkook are yet to be released.\n",

I haven't been able to decide where to get it so I'm trying to decide quickly. Will you guys help me decide? I'll go get it done with Jungkook once I choose where I'll get it done.\" When a fan suggested that he should get the tattoo under the left toe, V said, \"I also thought about it.\" Recently, RM revealed that he got the tattoo inked on his leg while eagle-eyed fans discovered that Jimin got it on his finger. V spoke about Jungkook's new song My You, released ahead of BTS' ninth anniversary, and said, \"Jungkook's song? I heard Jungkook's song about a month ago... it's good, isn't it?

Go to 'try not to laugh BTS version for 20 minutes'. Which pic/clip did you say was fun? The Hangul Day special? Episode 86? But this is legendary? I definitely won’t smile. Okay, let’s go. What kind of expression can we have? We just can’t show our teeth. The vibe is already funny. Isn’t my hair more of a 'try not to laugh challenge'?” The BTS member also spoke about actor Gang Dong-Won and watching the screening of Broker. \"Oh, I saw the VIP screening well. I really liked how he came to my Las Vegas concert and I was thankful so I went to his. He’s my role model. I do have a lot of role models. But he’s from my hometown. He’s so handsome.\" BTS' V started the live an hour before Proof Live and as fans asked him to watch it with them, he said, \"I don't think that's possible. I got off work... but I also need to go home right?\" However, he later said, \"Alright, let's all watch together. I'm going to watch this but since there are people who only have a phone... please go to (the Proof live) quickly.\" Earlier he had said, \"Now all the music shows pre-recordings have finished.. since we have the Proof live at 9 PM, I thought I'll come on live until then.. since a lot of ARMYs came today but a lot couldn't come so you might be sad, I thought I'd come live for you guys.\" Soon after the Proof Live started, V signed off from his live session.\n",

      "This year included several firsts for BTS, making them big moments for the group. As the year comes to an end, we take you on a brief journey on the major achievements and big moments of BTS this year. The year started with several BTS members facing health issues when they contracted Covid-19. Jin and Jimin even underwent finger and appendix surgeries, respectively, ahead of their concert in Seoul, their first on the home ground after over two years. Here's a recap of the big moments of BTS in 2022-- 1) Concerts in Seoul, Las Vegas, Busan: BTS’ Permission to Dance On Stage--Seoul concert was held in March. It was significant as it was the first time BTS had a concert with an in-person audience in the city in two and a half years. BTS next held their Permission to Dance On Stage concert in Las Vegas in April. The first concert came just days ahead of their performance at the Grammys. BTS also held its first free concert in Busan in October. For this show, BTS appeared 'without any additional fee' and HYBE invested their personal funds for the concert. 2) BTS members at Grammy's: The seven members performed at the 64th Grammy Awards in April, their first in-person performance for which they received a standing ovation. Just ahead of the show, BTS members contracted Covid-19 and Jin could partially perform due to his surgery. The performance saw the members pulling off a museum heist on their single Butter. 3) BTS 'on a break': Fans were left shocked and heartbroken when during the Festa dinner the group announced a 'hiatus'. Suga had said in a video during the dinner as per the English subtitles, “So we’ve entered an off-season. We’re going into a hiatus now.” He later added, “It’s not like we’re disbanding. We should live doing what we want to do...Writing lyrics is the hardest. What message do we want to give? Nothing comes out anymore.\" Later, AP quoted BigHit's clarification, “BTS are not taking a hiatus. Members will be focusing more on solo projects at this time.\" RM and Jungkook also issued clarifications that they will not go on a hiatus. 4) BTS album Proof: The group released their anthology album Proof in June. The album is a 3-CD collection of BTS’ hit old as well as new songs. Proof included three new songs--Yet to Come, Run BTS, and Born Singer. Their old hits I Need You, Run, Fire, Fake Love, Persona, Moon, are also part of the album. It released a few days before their ninth debut anniversary, on June 10. 5) BTS at the White House: The group attended the White House Press briefing in May to discuss anti-Asian hate crimes. They made history as they had a private meeting with US President Joe Biden at the White House for the first time ever. They were invited to the White House in celebration of Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders Heritage Month (AANHPI Heritage Month). The US President surprised the members by playing Butter in the Oval Office before their discussion to make them 'feel at home'. 6) BTS military enlistment: South Korea has a rule of mandatory military service for able-bodied men by 28. K-pop stars are granted the ability to defer their enrolment until 30. BTS ARMY has always dreaded the time when the members will have to spend months in the military. This year, in October, BigHit Music announced that military enlistment will begin with the eldest member Jin. All the other members--RM, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V aka Kim Taehyung and Jungkook will follow him. The group will reconvene in 2025. Though fans wished them well, the news left them emotional. Apart from these, BTS also made a comeback with their variety show, RUN BTS, after 10 months. Fans saw the members doing solo projects with Jimin singing With You for K-drama Our Blues, Suga produced and featured in That That with PSY, Suga and Jungkook came out with Stay Alive, and Jungkook treated fans to My You. The collaborations continued with Jungkook and Charlie Puth's Left and Right, J-Hope and Crush's Rush Hour, and Jin and Coldplay's Astronaut. While J-Hope released his first album Jack in the Box and performed at the Lollapalooza, RM too unveiled his first album Indigo. Jungkook became the first Asian artist to perform at the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar.\n",
      "Kim Namjoon aka RM of BTS is celebrating his birthday! And the BTS ARMY is celebrating his special day in the most special manner. There are various birthday projects organised by the ARMYs in the name of the BTS leader. Namjoon conducted a live on Weverse a couple of minutes ago. It's a ritual amongst the BTS members to spend a couple of hours with the ARMYs and Namjoon also joined ARMYs and celebrated his birthday with them while catching up. And during RM's birthday live, another BTS member J-hope aka Jung Hoseok spammed his session, but ARMYs are enjoying it So, in Hollywood News today, RM came live to chat with the ARMYs a bit. The Weverse made a glitch because of which he had to conduct two lives. RM's birthday cake was of Moni, his pet pooch and it was very adorable. RM talked about working on his album and revealed that it's almost done. However, Namjoon is not sure when it will release. He is hoping that his album comes out by the end of the year. Kim Namjoon also shared that he has been getting a lot of help from the other Bangtan Boys for his album and added that a lot of people helped him this time. RM talked about the newly released Decision to Love, a South Korean film, Balming Tiger and a lot of other things One member to never miss anything about the other Bangtannies is J-hope. Be it the albums or the pictures and now even Live session. J-hope spammed RM's live by commenting on it. It was hilarious and adorable. When RM turned emotional while talking about how the boys' hearts beat like one and how they are all always thinking about the same stuff, J-hope commented \"7 forever!!!!!!!!!\" he commented 7 multiple times and even wished Namjoon on live saying \"HB BFF.\" When RM was distracted Hobi dropped a lot of comments to cheer him up and called himself a successful fan ARMY is loving the interaction. Jhope was at home and had been spamming the comments about Namjoon's birthday live. Talking about which, Namjoon showed a little bit of his house and also shared that members have a lot of solo projects coming up. Also, what's with RM covering himself through and through? We hope he didn't chop off his tresses\n",

Yes, your read that right. As per a K-media report, Taehyung has been shooting for a variety show. So, BTS ARMY, if the reports are anything to go by, y'all might get to see Taehyung in a reality TV series, maybe, before he joins the military Apart from the BTS' military enlistment, the Bangtan Boys' solo projects also make headlines in the Hollywood News section. And such is the case with the Christmas Tree singer as well. As per a report in Daum.net, Kim Taehyung is a part of Lee Seojin's new reality series which is tentatively titled Seo Jin's.

Reading a comment, he said, as translated by @BTStranslation_, \"Why did I delete all the Instagram feed?\" Jungkook laughed and said, \"There's no reason for it. I just didn't like the vibes/setting of the feed so I thought of just redoing it. there was just something about it that I didn't like. I didn't even know there's a restoration time for it.\" When a fan asked why he changed his earrings to four, Jungkook said, \"I didn't really change the earrings, they just fell out, it didn't hurt or anything.\" Speaking about V, he said, \"Taehyungie is really handsome right? Yes! Among so many people I've seen, his looks are the most striking.. how can someone look like that.. he's really handsome, I agree.\" Jungkook did an impromptu dance of That That. Repeating the lines like PSY, he said, \"Yoongi hyung's (brother) hip thrust really.\" During the live, Jungkook said, \"The hair extensions.. from what I thought......I'm sorry. They were attached too early (in my opinion). I hope you guys will understand with a big heart.\" Speaking about growing his hair, Jungkook said, \"Am I growing my hair long? I had that triangle kimbap phase, right? At that time I just kept growing it and people and staff kept telling me to groom it.. only if I had listened to them at the time, I could've grown it a bit prettier.. now I'm trimming and growing at the back.\" When a fan asked his location, he said, \"Asking me where I am so that you can come where I am? it's so late right now, it's unsafe.\" He, however, revealed, \"Yes this is the sound of rain! I'm outside! Yes, I'm camping! I can't tell you where I am!\" Speaking about their ninth anniversary, he said, \"Yes we're preparing really hard.. since we'll see you guys soon right?\" He also said that he didn't exercise but drove on Tuesday.

I like odd numbers since there's an odd number in the middle.\" As he signed off, Jungkook said, \"Have a good night, good day, good day. I'm always thinking of all of you. I might look soulless but I'm being sincere/it’s true. See you next time! It was good to see you too.\"\n",

      "BTS’ RM has time and again shown his love for riding bicycles, so much so that he went ahead and released a song under the name of the vehicle on 6 June 2021 as a gift to his fans in celebration of BTS’ then-upcoming 8 year anniversary and the ongoing FESTA which is a yearly commemoration of the group’s debut June 3 is celebrated as World Bicycle Day and we think who better than the man and his song to celebrate it with ‘Bicycle’, is about to turn a year old soon and the song continues to be a slow pat on the head with its rhythmic beats and slow hums that are enough to lull you into a blissfully calm cluster of moments  The number presents itself as just that, a collection of the songwriter’s feelings as he maneuvers through the many turns of his life, characteristically placing his K-pop idol life under the microscope He talks about the moment of liberation on placing his two feet on the pedals, the one that also brings him despair over the many happenings of his life and longing for freedom as the pandemic came to be  The post-chorus is a string of “Na Na”, delivering the humming nature of his ride every time he drives around the town “슬프면 자전거를 타자” is how he begins the chorus, which translates to “If you are sad, let's ride a bicycle”  It signifies his go-to activity when he feels low is bicycle riding  He further adds to his unbinding moments by choosing to talk about the miracle that is now achievable, a midday dream come true RM and co-writer John Eun’s comparison of the bike ride to precious invisible things as one dances with the wind, looking like a bird, is relatable and takes you right back to a moment of unchained existence as the two wheels roll on a paved road Just as the singer wishes for the song to be a companion on the listener’s ride, we hope you can add it to your playlist after listening to it https://www youtube com/embed/6uq3P7zeYyUJoin the biggest community of K-Pop fans live on Pinkvilla Rooms to get one step closer to your favourite K-Celebs!

That’s what I think has always been important for me.\" A few months ago, BTS had announced that they are going separate ways to pursue solo careers, however, they pledged to return someday.

      "While the hyungs were enjoying the pizza, the two youngest tried not to give in to their cravings  Sat beside each other, the maknaes were controlling their urge to grab a bite from the many tasty-looking slices while the older members lightly teased them about it  It became a fight against their own decisions as the two members were on diet and stuck to not caving into the wants  Jungkook even went ahead and held a slice right against V&rsquo;s nose just to see if he would be tempted but the &lsquo;Sweet Night&rsquo; singer stuck to his resolve &nbsp;\n",

      "BTS played an upgraded version of the famed mafia game as they were divided into two teams in each round: the liar team and the citizens/villagers team  While they all tried their best to fool each other and find out who the actual liars are, it was only more apparent how well the BTS members knew each other and were accustomed to their presence  To add to the fun, each one of them was given electroencephalograph cat ears  As they lied or tried to be cheeky, the ears moved and made them look adorable  When a question about if they liked to take showers frequently or not was raised, they failed to lie and the liar team was found out easily  The next question was about them having fruity faces and though they faltered, it became a hilarious round of guessing who was which fruit  The last question was about dancing when sad and soon the fingers were pointed once again  In the end, the game came to a close with Jungkook being rightfully picked as the liar \n",

      "Is BTS really on a hiatus? Well, hiatus or not, there's no dearth of content featuring the Bangtan Boys – RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook. We would be getting some amazing solo content from BTS members soon RM aka Kim Namjoon is the leader of BTS, Bangtan Sonyeodan. He has been in charge of keeping together the other six members and maintaining harmony and leading the pack. And while doing so, Joonie aka RM turned from Rap Moster to RM (Real Me), father-figure types. From Namjoon comforting a crying Taehyung to being concerned about Jungkook and Jimin sleeping on the floor. From giving piggyback rides to J-Hope to helping the eldest child - Jin - whenever he is stuck. From collecting the members for a hug to cheering on the members being cute and adorable. And also being strict with the boys when they get out of hand, especially the maknae line - Park Jimin aka Jimin, Kim Taehyung aka V and Jeon Jungkook aka Jungkook. Despite RM not being the eldest member, he has turned into someone the Bangtan Boys rely on and look up to on various things. RM lets the boys be themselves and accepts all their shenanigans like a resigned father. Well, it is very funny and goofy. Who knew RM's dream of being a dad would come true in this way? Teehee, just kidding Meanwhile, RM is not new to solo projects. He has dropped two mixtapes of his own RM (2015) and Mono (2018) which were widely acclaimed. Mono had peaked at 26 on Billboard 200 which was the highest-charting album by a Korean soloist in chart history. BTS RM aka Kim Namjoon has collaborated with various artists such as Wale, Younha, Warren G, Gaeko, Krizz Kaliko, MFBTY, Fall Out Boy, Primary, and Lil Nas X to name a few. He has a KOMCA credit score of 199. He is gearing up for his solo album next and hopes that he is the one to release his solo project after J-Hope\n",
      "ARMY took to Twitter to share pictures of the tattoo, that appears to be RM's tribute to his seven-member band. 7 was also the name of the band's 2020 album. The fans are convinced that other members of the K-pop group must have also gotten similar tattoos, as they had previously discussed on several occasions. V had spoken about it on Weverse, saying, “We’ve been talking about friendship tattoos forever. We’ll do it someday. Please look forward to it.” RM had also talked about it in a V Live, revealing that they have had discussions about getting a friendship tattoo. He had said, \"Let’s tattoo seven dots or do seven of something. Or just simply tattoo the number seven. But if we’re actually doing it, I want to do it on the ankle. You know, it’s simple.” RM went with his last idea and tattooed the number seven on his ankle. ARMY flooded Twitter with comments about the tattoo. One wrote, \"OMG they got the 7 tattoo,\" while another commented, \"They finally did it.\" A third one wrote, \"OMGGG the friendship tattoo. I am screaming, crying.\" Another said, \"They freaking did it they got the tattooooooo.\" BTS will soon celebrate the ninth anniversary of its debut.

He added J-Hope was the first one to wish him on social media. Notonly he wished him but also called and sang his song Astronaut in an improvised manner—“When I’m with you, there is no Jin birthday.” Soon after, he ended his live birthday session and left his fans including Jimin upset. “That’s the end???? no ㅜㅜㅜ do (the live) more please ㅜㅜㅜㅠㅜㅠ,” commented Jimin in the end.

      "BTS members love their pets dearly. J-Hope is the proud owner of a Shih Tzu named Mickey. The little one is the darling of the Jung family. Some days back, J-Hope had told the BTS members that pets are love, but it hurts when they get old. Jung Hoseok said that their dog Mickey could not see now and it pained the whole family. Of late, he shared some pics with Mickey and his eyes looked a little different. Now, his sister Jiwoo wrote in her Insta stories that Mickey had glaucoma and was in a lot of pain. It seems they cried seeing their beloved pet lose his vision. Finally, they took a decision to get him operated. Now, their let manages to find his food and rest in his allotted space. Mickey is taken care of by J-Hope and Jiwoo's parents It seems Mickey was left at a gas station by an elderly couple 12 years ago. She said their daughter brought him home but had gone away. It has become tough for them to look after a young pup. J-Hope's mom and sister brought Mickey home and made him their pet. She said she could not help her parents in caring for Mickey as much as she did before as she was married now. But she said that the Jung family would collectively do everything to keep their 'youngest child' happy and healthy. ARMY had a meltdown reading her post. A fan wrote about how J-Hope always encourages adoption of pets. He apparently once paid for treatment of an injured stray cat BTS is now on a holiday. RM, V, Jungkook, SUGA, Jimin, Jin and J-Hope are spending time with their families after years. The last time they took a long break was in 2019. The septet is expected to be back with the Seoul concert. J-Hope's birthday is coming in some days. Fans are hoping for Hope World 2 soon\n",

      "During season three of BTS' reality show Bon Voyage in 2018, group members travelled to Malta where they engaged in several activities. While walking around one evening, Jungkook came near a place where people were busking. As he looked around, a member of his crew asked if he wanted to sing too and he smiled expressing his wish. When Jin and J-Hope came to know about Jungkook, they ran to the area. As they rushed, Jin said, \"He's different. The main vocalist of BTS is different.\" When they met Jungkook, J-Hope said, \"We came here because we heard you're going to sing.\" As Jungkook sought suggestions, Jin and J-Hope bombarded him with songs such as Torri Kelly, Love You Hate You, Paper Heart, and La La Land. After much discussion, Jungkook said he would sing Adam Levine's Lost Stars. Walking up to the mic, Jungkook bowed and greeted the people, \"Nice to meet you.\" He then spoke in Korean to Jin and J-Hope sitting nearby, \"I drank a little.\" As J-Hope said, \"You can do it. You will be fine. It's okay\", he replied, \"I don't care if I ruin it.\" Before starting the song he said his iconic line, \"Let's get it\" leaving Jin and J-Hope in splits. Watch video of Jungkook busking on Malta While Junkook sang, J-Hope recorded the video while the crowd listened to him. As he concluded the song and said, \"Sorry, thank you\", the crowd was heard hooting, screaming and clapping. When they made their way to the hotel, J-Hope told Jungkook, \"All the people were singing along. Right, everyone next to us was singing along.\" Jungkook who was watching the recording on J-Hope's phone, returned it to him saying, \"I'm too embarrassed to watch it. I was off-tune. I messed the song up. I was all over the place tune-wise. Next time I'll be fully prepared.\" Jin and J-Hope cheered him up saying, \"It was very beautiful. I feel like I'm in love. No, you did well. You were in tune.\" In June, Jungkook collaborated with singer Charlie Puth on a new single Left and Right. BTS is currently on a break as a unit with the members pursuing solo projects. The group is awaiting their show titled Yet to Come in October where they will perform to support South Korea's bid to host the 2030 World Expo in Busan.

      "BTS and tales of their sasaeng fans are well-known. Now, one incident has been reported where a former sasaeng fan of the septet from Japan revealed how her obsession affected her life. It seems she was recruited by a Korean sasaeng who had told her to follow the band, and find out if Jungkook was dating someone or not. Koreaboo has revealed an incident which has been narrated on a YouTube channel Kisses Dahlia. A Japanese fan has said that she became a K-Pop fan in 2017, and BTS was her fave It seems she became famous because of the high quality pics that she took when she went to their concerts. This led to her being approached by a Korean sasaeng. She was given a 'job' to spy on the boys and take their pics. It seems she took up the offer because she needed the money. However, the sasaeng culture is very exhausting and found it worrying when she started enjoying the act of spying on the boys. The fan has said that her sister found out that she is a sasaeng and sent her for therapy. The girl has said that she is regretful of her actions and understands how sasaeng culture is harmful Even today Jimin said that some fans were calling him when he was doing his VLive with J-Hope after the Lollapalooza Festival. Fans wondered if they were sasaengs who were troubling the boys. We also remember how Jungkook kept getting calls in the middle of the night as he did a VLive chat during the Las Vegas tour. Sasaengs have been known to book tickets in same flights as the boys due to which they stopped taking commercial flights. Once, a sasaeng tried to kiss SUGA but was held by the bodyguard\n",
      "A fan of Jazz music, V, aka Kim Taehyung, also teased that fans 'might be able to hear something jazzy' from him soon. He said that he liked jazz ever since he was a schoolboy, but it’s something that he 'only admired from afar and never dared to do myself'. He also said that he is 'intrigued' by whatever ARMY finds interesting. V added that as ARMY has been talking about wanting to hear him on the radio, so he wants 'to try some deejaying'. In an interview with Vogue Korea, V said, \"There is a feeling of responsibility in whatever I do, but I don’t regret what I’ve done. I want to be a good person for those who love me. Our ARMY, BTS members, family and friends keep me happy and healthy even when I’m hurt and struggling. I cherish human connection. I am a people person and I truly enjoy working with everyone I cross professional paths with, including artists, directors, writers, and journalists like you. In the past, I used to be more reserved because I had been hurt by people who treated me simply as a valuable asset to know and not as a friend. But I still like people. It is thanks to the wonderful people in my life that I am who I am now.\" Speaking about the BTS members, V said, \"We are a really positive group and all eager to unconditionally support each other. We had a meeting recently at Suga’s place to play the music we had been working on individually. We were dancing and praising each other non-stop. Being able to pursue one’s own music style lights the passion and enthusiasm in us. That’s what keeps us in love with what we do. I love seeing that.\" V will be seen next with the other BTS members at a concert in Busan in support of the city's bid to host the World Expo in 2030. The Yet To Come free concert will be held at 6 pm on October 15 at the Asiad Main Stadium. Earlier, it was scheduled to take place at Busan Ilgwang special stage in Gijang-gun.\n",

The tour began in October 2014 in South Korea, it was extended to a world tour in June 2015. They performed in Malaysia, Australia, the US and Hong Kong. In the next picture, J-Hope gave a peek at the handwritten letter given to him on his birthday. Sharing the letter, J-Hope captioned the post, \"When we were young.\" He also tagged Jimin. As translated by Twitter user @BTStranslation_, the letter read, \"To, Hoseokie hyung (elder brother). Ah hyung. Since this is the first time I'm writing a letter to a member, so it's a little awkward (laughs). I'm dying of the cheesiness (laughs). I couldn't celebrate hyung's birthday last year as I wanted so it kept bothering me. But this time I wanted anything at all out of (what I wanted) so I've tried preparing even if it's simple.\" \"I'm always thankful and please guide (us) the members well in the future too. Hyung probably also has a lot of worries and tough things but thank you for always working even harder than the members without showing it. It'll be hard in future too so please really take care of your body well. These days (your/our) body aches often too but... Anyway, and happy birthday from the bottom of my heart. In future too, I might upset you (sometimes) so please look after me well-! (very cutely) Love you! (very cutely) - dongsaeng (younger sibling) Jiminie,\" it read.s In the next Instagram Story, J-Hope tagged BTS members RM and Suga. He held an Eminem concert ticket dated August 19, 2012, in his hand. In the last photo, J-Hope wore a smiley bucket hat and a mask covering his face as he looked down. The rapper wore a black T-shirt and stood inside a room. BTS members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook are awaiting the release of their upcoming anthology album Proof. It will release on June 10 and consist of old and new tracks.\n",
      "Earlier Jimin had shared a post, saying, \"I made the title for Yoongi hyung's (elder brother) V Live.\" The title for Suga's Live was, 'My hair has grown a lot longer'. When a fan teased Suga saying that he's getting younger, he laughed and said, \"I'm 30, I'm not that old yet.\" Speaking about the original soundtrack, Stay Alive, that he produced for the webtoon 7 Fates Chakho, Suga asked the feedback of his viewers. As translated by Twitter user @BTStranslation_ Yoongi spoke about both the tracks--Stay Alive and Girl of My Dreams, revealing that he wrote the lyrics for the songs on the flight to the US. He also said he recorded Girl of My Dreams almost as soon as he landed there. Suga then spoke about the lyrics of Stay Alive and also about Jungkook who sang the song. \"I wrote the lyrics for Stay Alive with keeping the webtoon in mind. Jungkook recorded the song so well. The chorus was so high but he didn't even do a re-recording, it was approved at once. He's a person overflowing with talent.\" When a fan asked if Suga was working on Stay Alive in In The Soop, he replied, \"Yes right. But at the time Jungkook's melody was not put in the song. It's the one I was working on in In The Soop.\" Suga also promised ARMY that he will hold a live session on his birthday, which is on March 9. \"It's my birthday soon, I'll see you guys on my birthday. I'll come live again on my birthday,\" he said. When asked what he planned to do on his special day, Suga replied, \"What will I do on my birthday? The day after is concert day so I don't think I can do much (laughed).\" BTS will hold three concerts in Seoul this month. The BTS Permission To Dance On Stage-Seoul is scheduled on March 10, 12 and 13. The BTS member also spoke about their home concert next week, \"The concert is going to be very fun. We're preparing hard. We've been looking forward to a concert in Korea. It will still be quite chilly in March so I'm trying not to get sick.\" About their Las Vegas concert, Suga said, \"I'm excited for the Vegas concert too, the renewed venue. The stadium itself looked so cool, we saw it while passing by.\" The dates of the concerts are April 8, 9, 15 and 16. When a fan teased him saying Bangtan (BTS) is so lucky they can go to Bangtan concert, Suga laughed and said, \"Haha, they (we) go every time.\" A fan wrote, \"If I can't go to the concert I'll die\", Suga responded laughing, \"It's not like that. You can watch it online too.\" When he asked ARMY to not get 'too nervous' during ticketing and be calm, a fan said, \"Is there a way not to get nervous (about ticketing)?\" He replied, \"Just do it as you normally would. Like when you're choosing from a menu.\" The BTS members--RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook last December debuted on Instagram. Speaking about his feed, Suga said, \"I don't know what pictures to upload on Instagram. I don't know how to make my feed look pretty, either. I normally don't take pictures. I'm still not sure what this 'Instagram vibe' is all about.\" Suga who recently recovered from Covid-19, said, \"My condition is all better now. It's been like three months since I contracted it (Covid-19). People don't always catch it cause they didn't take care. No one wants to contract it on purpose. It's not your fault.\" Suga also replied when asked if his pet Holly still walks all over him, \"Yes. When I get home he comes with his clothes held in his mouth like let's go on a walk. He's sleeping right next to me every day.\"\n",

       " 'BTS members RM, Jin, V, and Jungkook featured in a new Bangtan Bomb video from last year when they performed at The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The video was dropped on Bangtan TV\\'s YouTube channel on Wednesday. It showed the members recording their dance performances to their tracks Butter and Dynamite for the show. Titled BTS’s Chaotic Break Time, the video started with Jungkook giving an update about the members. \"We just finished Dynamite and Butter. We\\'re recording it but the song (Butter) hasn\\'t been released yet. It hasn\\'t hit me yet. Until it\\'s really released we\\'ll keep preparing and practising whenever we have time.\" As Jungkook spoke, V stood behind him giving directions to Jin on what to say on camera. At first, Jin spoke about his appearance in the song, \"It\\'s not that I opened the performance fancy. I just stood up and walked. If that looked fancy all I could say is that my face was fancy.\" Jin then burst out laughing and said, \"Our members are listening to this through the mic so it\\'s a bit embarrassing.\" While talking, Jin kept on shifting his glances at the camera and V. He then showed a finger heart revealing that V asked him to do so. Speaking about V, Jin said, \"He said to say something to the camera. He told me to say ‘Please look forward to it’.\" As V continued giving instructions on the mic set, Jin obediently repeated it in the camera, \"He said he loves ARMY. He said he can\\'t wait to hold a concert.\" Following this, RM became the next member to feature in the clip. As soon as he showed up, Jin and V joined him and they started interrupting each other\\'s interviews. RM started with, \"Hello. Welcome to the first day of our Butter promotion. I sincerely...\" However, he was cut off by V saying, \"You have nose hair.\" As RM moved away, V said in the camera, \"Hello ARMY, I\\'m Kin Taehyung.\" Here Jin said, \"You have mouth hair.\" V walked away and Jin said, \"Hello everyone. This is Jin.\" But V interrupted saying, \"You have armpit hair.\" As he started talking facing the camera, RM came and said, \"You have eye hair.\" Smiling at the camera, RM said, \"It\\'s s nice to meet you guys.\" As V walked into the frame asking RM, \"You got neck hair?\", Jin told the group leader, \"You look handsome today.\" Finally, Jin was able to say, \"Hello. I\\'m Jin. What we\\'re doing today is recording Butter. It\\'s very awkward since no one\\'s pushing their way in. Fighting!\" Next on V\\'s target was Jungkook. As the youngest member said, \"We\\'ll continue to show you good performances\" V pushed him out of the frame saying, \"Outta my way.\" As the video ended, V said, \"Everyone, please look forward to it.\" Last year, BTS members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook had to participate in a skit for The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Butter released in May last year and clinched the top spot of the Billboard Hot 100 for nine consecutive weeks. The song also broke several records including Most Viewers for the Premiere of a Music Video on YouTube, Most Viewers for the Premiere of a Video on YouTube, Most-viewed YouTube Music Video in 24 hours by a K-pop group and Most Viewed YouTube Music Video in 24 hours.',\n",

Speaking to the fans, J-Hope said, \"The process of this album that began from desire and childish ambitiousness, we\\'re moving magnificently towards the finale of one of the processes. Through this album, all the schedules became my blood and flesh (part of me) and while looking at you all and our ARMY & the public while (performing in) Lollapalooza today, once again I think another determination and definite faith has formed.\" Speaking about Jimin, J-Hope said, \"Since the moment he came, I\\'ve had the smile flower bloomed on me. I was really into the process as you felt when you came here, it was a world of darkness, you came and became my light.

Anderson also spoke a few words in Korean. He also revealed, \"It was my son because he\\'s a big fan, he made me a fan. I\\'ve been obsessed, I\\'ve been ARMY ever since.\" They also spoke about attending each other\\'s concerts and complimented them. After the rapper left, the members spoke about their \\'best moments so far\\' in their careers. J-Hope said that it was the day BTS was born, June 13, 2013, while Jimin recalled it as the day when BTS had their solo concert in 2014. Suga said for him, it was BTS\\' showcase day on June 12, 2013, \"I still remember the basement floor at the King Kong building, Ilchi Art Hall.\" RM said that when BTS had their first concert at the Olympic Gymnastic Arena, it was his \\'best moment\\'. V said, \"For me, it was those days when Jungkook would cry if I asked, \\'Are you crying?\\' That was the best moment for me.\" The other members teased him. Jungkook recalled that the day he joined BTS was his \\'best moment\\'. \"I believe BTS wouldn\\'t exist without me. I\\'m sorry that was a joke,\" he said. Jin credited all the moments so far as his \\'best moment\\'. BTS members next spoke about their journey since Covid-19 in 2020 during which \\'a lot of things changed\\' for them and the ARMY. RM said, \"Most of the things we\\'ve done since 2020 weren\\'t planned in advance. None of it was planned.\" Suga added, \"Nothing went as planned.\" RM continued, \"As we went on we were sometimes a little afraid and unsure if we were on the right path. We\\'ve also had growing reservations about what was the right answer.\" Jimin said, \"We thought the pandemic would be over soon...but none of us thought that it would take more than two years.\" Suga said, \"We\\'re like \\'Let\\'s give it three months. We\\'ll be able to have a concert in three months\\'.\" Jungkook added that it was then the group came out with their song Dynamite as it was their \\'way of braving the Covid-19 pandemic\\'. They also spoke about their album BE, songs Butter and Permission to Dance and their concerts. Speaking about Proof, V said, \"If you look closely many of our unreleased songs are included in this album. We took those songs as a chance to reminisce on when they were recorded. We also wanted to wrap up our first chapter, that\\'s why we created our album.\" Suga added, \"When I grow interested in an artist, it\\'s hard to listen to all their albums. This album is like the essence. Once you follow this guide, you\\'ll get a rough idea of who BTS is. It\\'s like a textbook or a guidebook you can show to beginners.\" Last week BTS released Proof via BigHit Music. The album, comprising three discs, is a look back on the group\\'s journey in the last near decade. The songs in the album comprise the members\\' personal selections from their old tracks. It is a gift to ARMY and also features a brand-new single Yet to Come (The Most Beautiful Moment), Run BTS, and For Youth.',\n",
       " 'During the episode, the members took a trip down memory lane as they visited their dorms, spoke about eating icecreams, visiting a particular restaurant and taking walks near their dorm. They also recalled the famous dumpling incident (involving a heated argument between Jimin and V) and the banana incident (when Jungkook noticed fruits disappearing from the fruit basket ARMY gave him. At that time, Jungkook argued saying it was his and J-Hope got angry, threw a banana at him and said, \\'You eat it all\\'). While taking a walk near their dorm, RM recalled how the members walked on the street every day during the initial days of their career. He also said how he and V got caught while having ice cream. Recalling the exact spot, RM said, “I got caught exactly around here. I took the ice cream cone and stuffed it in my pocket. He (the person) asked where we were going, so we just said, \\'Back to our dorm\\'. In the end, the ice cream melted in my pocket, but I didn\\'t want to waste it. So I took it off and ate it again.” While RM and Jimin took a walk, Jin and V feasted on Jajangmyeon (Korean noodle dish). Suga sat in his car outside the restaurant that the members frequented earlier. The members tried to figure out each other\\'s locations as they travelled in their cars around the city. By round two, Jungkook joined RM, Jin, Jimin, and V. Suga also met J-Hope near their old dorm and screamed \\'my friend\\' from his car. All the members met at the Jamwon Han River Park and hugged each other. For a few moments, they forgot about filming and huddled together asking each other where they first went. The crew had to interrupt asking them to face the camera. In the last round, the members were given the keyword, ARMY. Though they were together, they could not discuss which place they would go to separately. RM kept hinting to J-Hope, \"We can go back to a place we\\'ve been already.\" He suggested the Olympic Stadium. All the members were seen heading to the venue except V who chose the first showcase venue of BTS. He said, \"I\\'ll ask ARMY if it should be the first concert or first showcase.\" However, he got shy and couldn\\'t ask anyone despite making several attempts in Garosu-gil. The video ended with all of them meeting for lunch during which the members discussed on what to do next. RM suggested \\'getting middle-aged men from just around neighbourhood and playing 7-7 volleyball\\'. Jungkook suggested they learn Sepak takraw, a game, Jin asked about farming, and Suga came up with the idea of racing. Jimin said, \" I want to try pole dancing too.\" RM added, \"That suits you though.\" The video ended with V goofily saying, \"Run BTS will continue running.\"',\n",

The newest episode of Run BTS dropped on Weverse, VLIVE and YouTube dropped a couple of hours ago. Run BTS is officially back! Since we still have to wait for another Tuesday for the continuation episode of Run BTS, we thought of bringing back some of the funniest and most entertaining episodes for y'all to binge-watch in your free time, meanwhile In this Run BTS episodes, BTS members – RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook pick their Manito and then play the game of jumping into the photo zone and axing expressions based on the given keywords. In the second episode of BTS X Manito, they play the game of Bingo based on food items on their bingo chart. The members have to act out the food items and the others have to guess the answer and tick off the list. These two are by far the most hilarious episodes of Run BTS In this episode of Run BTS, we saw the epic whisper challenge game where Jin aka Kim Seokjin showcased his amazing telepathic abilities and Jimin introduced us to La Chi Mo La La Not that the VR game part 1 is not that fun but the Part 2 of VR games played by the Bangtan Boys was more fun. J-Hope was the funniest especially when she dropped from the high rise. Taetae's swag to Jungkook being the pro at playing games was a sight for ARMYs BTS ARMY, if you want to have a good laugh while watching Run BTS episodes these two are great for laughter packs. It was in the second episode of Summer Outing that the boys had to fight with Jungkook and he still won the game. Jungkook is quite agile The Bangtan Boys - RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook played some fun games whilst in Pajamas. The most fun part was chimchim aka Park Jimin's sketches on socks to guess the word by drawing. Guess who was the artist of the episode at that time? In this episode, the Bangtan Boys played games that they played in the past. Taehyung's memory power left the members speechless. The Rapline and the vocal line had been divided into two groups and the Rap line was at their hilarious best. The second episode also saw the return of the photo booth In these two episodes of Run BTS, we saw the Bangtan Boys getting missions. Hidden between them was a spy. The missions were to click photos with the rest of the members based on certain themes. However, when the soy was revealed, the Bangtan Boys felt the shock of their lives The 77-minute Debate episodes are the funniest of the lot. The boys were divided into two teams and had to debate about foods and everything under the sun which makes them the goofiest. The main factor here is the water shower based on the banned word. Jungkook, Jimin and other Bangtan Boys when learned the banned words they used them to trouble the judge in the centre. It was laughter riots of the two episodes Meanwhile, the latest episode of Run BTS featured the Bangtan Boys – RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook playing the game of telepathy and revealing how much they still know about each others' thoughts and ways of doing things\",\n",

       " 'BTS members Jimin and V featured in a new Bangtan Bomb video. The clip, which was released on Tuesday on Bangtan TV\\'s YouTube channel, showed them recall how they interacted with fans on camera after they debuted with RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope and Jungkook in 2013. The video started with BTS\\' Jimin and V warming up using a chair before shooting for their track Butter last year. As Jimin lifted the chair over his head, V told him, \"You\\'ve to straighten your arms.\" He replied, \"I can\\'t go any higher because of the jacket. Here\\'s the limit (as he showed how far he can lift the chair above him).\" As their staff worked around them, they continued their exercise smiling. Next, Jimin came to the camera as he covered nearly the entire lens. He said, \"Now we only have one last shooting left.\" V peered over his shoulder and asked what he was doing and if he was having fun. Jimin responded by laughing, \"It\\'s what we used to do when we debuted. We used to do this a lot when we debuted. We\\'d get greedy and want to show more for our fans.\" Jimin then added, \"We are talking now.\" Pointing at V, he said, \"He used to do this a lot.\" V added, \"It\\'s true that I used to say things like that.\" The video ended with Jimin and V talking in \\'sim\\' language, as the caption read, all the while laughing and pulling each other\\'s legs. All the BTS members, who are on an \\'extended period of rest\\', are gearing up for their upcoming concerts in Seoul next month.

The concerts, Permission to Dance on Stage-Seoul, will take place at Seoul\\'s Olympic Stadium on March 10, 12 and 13, and will also be live-streamed, the group\\'s agency Bit Hit Music had said. Their last concert for South Korean fans was in October 2019, a couple of months before the coronavirus began. As the pandemic spread in 2020, the band postponed and then called off their international tour involving nearly 40 concerts. They held some online shows instead. BTS debuted in 2013 and have produced many songs over the years. In November last year, they created history by becoming the first Asian artists to win the top prize at the American Music Awards. They played their first in-person concerts since the onset of the pandemic in November, in Los Angles. The pandemic also affected a few members--RM, Jin, Suga, Jimin and V, as they contracted the coronavirus. However, all of them have fully recovered.',\n",
       " 'Recently, Jungkook along with the other group members RM, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, and V held a live session on V Live. However, Jin wasn\\'t present with them as he underwent surgery for his finger injury. During the live, a fan asked, \"What happened to Jungkook’s shirt during Fake Love?\" At this, Suga asked if the button really popped off and Jungkook replied, as translated by Twitter user @btsbaragi_jk, \"It got unbuttoned.\" The other members started teasing him. Suga asked, \"You didn’t do that on purpose?\" Jimin said, \"You seemed to be continuously laughing and smiling as you performed.\" RM said, \"I saw him before we went in (on stage) and he was pulling it off (at the thread) a lot.\" Jungkook said, \"The reason I laughed is because I buttoned it up once but it got undone again so I was dumbfounded.\" Suga reminded RM that previously he had once accidentally ripped off Jungkook\\'s buttons. To this Jungkook, added, \"I did give it a thought. Since its already unbuttoned, should I unbutton another one? Should I just completely unbutton it?’\" V chimed in saying, \"I think it would be nice if you performed by taking it off one day.\" Jungkook replied, \"No, not for me. I’m not ready yet.\" Jimin added, \"As far as I know, at the time, the fans couldn’t hold back their cheers and a sound came out of their mouths.\" He was speaking of the time during the concert when Jungkook\\'s blazer got unbuttoned. Suga asked Jungkook, \"I heard you went in after putting in on oil on day three.\" While RM and J-Hope laughed, Jungkook said, \"But I always do that since I have to show my abs. Always have to be prepared.\" Speaking about Jin, Suga said that he is taking rest and Jimin added that he is recovering well. RM said, \"Don\\'t worry too much, you guys, he said he\\'s okay. The surgery was short and he\\'s okay honestly.\" The live saw Jin\\'s representative, BT21 character RJ\\'s soft toy. Referring to it, Jungkook said, \"That\\'s why this friend came (RJ). Jimin said, \"Jin hyung (brother) told us to convey his greeting to you guys. We saw him today\" and RM added, \"On seeing him, he was doing fine.\" Next, their conversation steered towards their Instagram accounts. Suga asked J-Hope if he has deleted all his Instagram photos. J-Hope replied, \"No. I moved a couple over to archive. I didn\\'t delete it. I moved them to the archive. Turns out you can bring them back later. I searched about it.\" Jimin also spoke on why he doesn\\'t share posts on Instagram regularly. He said, \"With Instagram, I can’t go on it because I’m scared I might press something wrong.\" As RM urged him to share posts he said he will. The members concluded the session by saying that they will hold another live in Las Vegas. BTS will perform in Las Vegas\\' Allegiant Stadium on April 8, April 9, April 15, and April 16.',\n",
       " 'Jay Park took to his Instagram account on Tuesday to share pictures from his recent meeting with Jungkook, and showered the K-pop star with praises. The first picture was a selfie in which Jungkook pouted as he kept his arm around Jay Park, who flashed a huge smile. In the second picture, both of them posed against a music workstation. Sharing the pictures, Jay wrote, “Even though he’s at the top, he has a growth mindset and he’s humble. What a stud… Plus he’s good at boxing… After I met Jk I can definitely see why they get so much love. Humble, [ambitious] and talented.\" Jungkook shared the post on his Instagram Stories. The post soon received several comments from fans asking if Jungkook is planning to collaborate with the American rapper, who was previously a part of K-pop group 2PM. Many fans commented \"OMG,\" with one writing, \"Are they making music together?? Collab?\" Another commented, \"Right now I will start praying that they make a song together, out of Jungkook\\'s comfort zone, something Jay Park style.\" However, a large section of ARMY was not happy about the meeting and took to Twitter to say that they cannot forgive Jay Park. The Seattle-based rapper had risen to fame as the leader of the South Korean boy band 2PM in 2008. But he left the band and South Korea and returned home the next year following a major controversy when the comments he wrote about Korea in 2005 as a teenager were publicised by the Korean media. In addition, he had also previously criticised BTS in several tweets. He wrote in one such tweet in 2018, “Two ppl on the plane asked me if I was part of BTS … lol I need to get my weight up.\" ARMY cited these tweets as they suggested that Jungkook is posing with him because he is being held hostage. \"Free Jungkook of Jay Park,\" one wrote, while another commented, \"Free Jungkook. he only did what he had to do he didn’t mean it #jkheldhostage #jkhostagesituation.\" A third one wrote, \"Jungkook prolly the nicest person on earth i know damn well that mf had a gun on the other side forcing him to take a selfie ! praying jungkook got home safely without finding out he lost his wallet #freejungkook.\" Another commented, \"Jay Park the biggest hypocrite ever because he acted like he didn\\'t shade BTS and ARMYS in the past but now he\\'s all smiling and acting like a saint.\" Meanwhile, BTS members Jungkook, Jin, Jimin, J-Hope, Suga, and V have returned to South Korea after their Permission to Dance concert in Las Vegas. Group leader RM was not spotted with them during their arrival at Seoul airport on Tuesday.',\n",
       " 'The video started with Jimin sitting in his car on his way to the shop. He said, \"I\\'ve always wanted to go to a workshop and make jewellery. I\\'ve always wanted to try it. You all know that I like jewellery. So I thought I could go and make some simple bracelets for today. So that\\'s where I\\'m going right now.\" He also said, \"I got my wisdom tooth pulled out. After I got my wisdom tooth out I ate more and gained weight. I\\'m about 64.7 kg right now. I\\'m gonna make jewellery and go on a diet.\" At the workshop, Jimin worked on making the jewellery. However, he broke the blade of the saw, he was working with, twice. He said, \"I\\'m so sorry. I just broke the last one and broke it again. I\\'m very sorry.\" After getting the second replacement of the blade Jimin said, \"Please last this time.\" After sawing, Jimin filed the metal and continued with the process to make the bracelet. As he hammered a metal piece, he asked the people, \"Don\\'t I look like an employee here? Are you here to pick up a project? What if I become your best apprentice?\" Jimin continued working on the jewellery and said, \"It feels so exciting. This is fun. So much effort goes into this.\" Jimin, after finishing making the bracelets, said, \"I\\'ll wear one on each wrist. It went faster than I expected.\" Wearing them he showed it to the camera and said, \"These are the nice bracelets I made. I\\'m so satisfied and had so much fun. The hammering was especially fun for me. The shaping process was fun. The sawing part was the hardest. It was so fun. If ARMY wants to try this kind of hobby too or if you want to make something valuable for yourself in a quiet place, it\\'ll be fun to go to a workshop like this.\" Bangtan TV has been sharing videos featuring the vlogs of BTS members every week. So far V shared his vlog where he had meals with his crew, played golf and travelled around the city. In J-Hope\\'s vlog, he gave a glimpse of the shooting of his latest album, Jack in the Box.

       " 'This year included several firsts for BTS, making them big moments for the group. As the year comes to an end, we take you on a brief journey on the major achievements and big moments of BTS this year. The year started with several BTS members facing health issues when they contracted Covid-19. Jin and Jimin even underwent finger and appendix surgeries, respectively, ahead of their concert in Seoul, their first on the home ground after over two years. Here\\'s a recap of the big moments of BTS in 2022-- 1) Concerts in Seoul, Las Vegas, Busan: BTS’ Permission to Dance On Stage--Seoul concert was held in March. It was significant as it was the first time BTS had a concert with an in-person audience in the city in two and a half years. BTS next held their Permission to Dance On Stage concert in Las Vegas in April. The first concert came just days ahead of their performance at the Grammys. BTS also held its first free concert in Busan in October. For this show, BTS appeared \\'without any additional fee\\' and HYBE invested their personal funds for the concert. 2) BTS members at Grammy\\'s: The seven members performed at the 64th Grammy Awards in April, their first in-person performance for which they received a standing ovation. Just ahead of the show, BTS members contracted Covid-19 and Jin could partially perform due to his surgery. The performance saw the members pulling off a museum heist on their single Butter. 3) BTS \\'on a break\\': Fans were left shocked and heartbroken when during the Festa dinner the group announced a \\'hiatus\\'. Suga had said in a video during the dinner as per the English subtitles, “So we’ve entered an off-season. We’re going into a hiatus now.” He later added, “It’s not like we’re disbanding. We should live doing what we want to do...Writing lyrics is the hardest. What message do we want to give? Nothing comes out anymore.\" Later, AP quoted BigHit\\'s clarification, “BTS are not taking a hiatus. Members will be focusing more on solo projects at this time.\" RM and Jungkook also issued clarifications that they will not go on a hiatus. 4) BTS album Proof: The group released their anthology album Proof in June. The album is a 3-CD collection of BTS’ hit old as well as new songs. Proof included three new songs--Yet to Come, Run BTS, and Born Singer. Their old hits I Need You, Run, Fire, Fake Love, Persona, Moon, are also part of the album. It released a few days before their ninth debut anniversary, on June 10. 5) BTS at the White House: The group attended the White House Press briefing in May to discuss anti-Asian hate crimes. They made history as they had a private meeting with US President Joe Biden at the White House for the first time ever. They were invited to the White House in celebration of Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders Heritage Month (AANHPI Heritage Month). The US President surprised the members by playing Butter in the Oval Office before their discussion to make them \\'feel at home\\'. 6) BTS military enlistment: South Korea has a rule of mandatory military service for able-bodied men by 28. K-pop stars are granted the ability to defer their enrolment until 30. BTS ARMY has always dreaded the time when the members will have to spend months in the military. This year, in October, BigHit Music announced that military enlistment will begin with the eldest member Jin. All the other members--RM, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V aka Kim Taehyung and Jungkook will follow him. The group will reconvene in 2025. Though fans wished them well, the news left them emotional. Apart from these, BTS also made a comeback with their variety show, RUN BTS, after 10 months. Fans saw the members doing solo projects with Jimin singing With You for K-drama Our Blues, Suga produced and featured in That That with PSY, Suga and Jungkook came out with Stay Alive, and Jungkook treated fans to My You. The collaborations continued with Jungkook and Charlie Puth\\'s Left and Right, J-Hope and Crush\\'s Rush Hour, and Jin and Coldplay\\'s Astronaut. While J-Hope released his first album Jack in the Box and performed at the Lollapalooza, RM too unveiled his first album Indigo. Jungkook became the first Asian artist to perform at the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar.',\n",

       " \"Is BTS really on a hiatus? Well, hiatus or not, there's no dearth of content featuring the Bangtan Boys – RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook. We would be getting some amazing solo content from BTS members soon RM aka Kim Namjoon is the leader of BTS, Bangtan Sonyeodan. He has been in charge of keeping together the other six members and maintaining harmony and leading the pack. And while doing so, Joonie aka RM turned from Rap Moster to RM (Real Me), father-figure types. From Namjoon comforting a crying Taehyung to being concerned about Jungkook and Jimin sleeping on the floor. From giving piggyback rides to J-Hope to helping the eldest child - Jin - whenever he is stuck. From collecting the members for a hug to cheering on the members being cute and adorable. And also being strict with the boys when they get out of hand, especially the maknae line - Park Jimin aka Jimin, Kim Taehyung aka V and Jeon Jungkook aka Jungkook. Despite RM not being the eldest member, he has turned into someone the Bangtan Boys rely on and look up to on various things. RM lets the boys be themselves and accepts all their shenanigans like a resigned father. Well, it is very funny and goofy. Who knew RM's dream of being a dad would come true in this way? Teehee, just kidding Meanwhile, RM is not new to solo projects. He has dropped two mixtapes of his own RM (2015) and Mono (2018) which were widely acclaimed. Mono had peaked at 26 on Billboard 200 which was the highest-charting album by a Korean soloist in chart history. BTS RM aka Kim Namjoon has collaborated with various artists such as Wale, Younha, Warren G, Gaeko, Krizz Kaliko, MFBTY, Fall Out Boy, Primary, and Lil Nas X to name a few. He has a KOMCA credit score of 199. He is gearing up for his solo album next and hopes that he is the one to release his solo project after J-Hope\",\n",

Since this is the first time I\\'m writing a letter to a member, so it\\'s a little awkward (laughs). I\\'m dying of the cheesiness (laughs). I couldn\\'t celebrate hyung\\'s birthday last year as I wanted so it kept bothering me. But this time I wanted anything at all out of (what I wanted) so I\\'ve tried preparing even if it\\'s simple.\" \"I\\'m always thankful and please guide (us) the members well in the future too. Hyung probably also has a lot of worries and tough things but thank you for always working even harder than the members without showing it. It\\'ll be hard in future too so please really take care of your body well. These days (your/our) body aches often too but... Anyway, and happy birthday from the bottom of my heart. In future too, I might upset you (sometimes) so please look after me well-! (very cutely) Love you!

       " 'Earlier Jimin had shared a post, saying, \"I made the title for Yoongi hyung\\'s (elder brother) V Live.\" The title for Suga\\'s Live was, \\'My hair has grown a lot longer\\'. When a fan teased Suga saying that he\\'s getting younger, he laughed and said, \"I\\'m 30, I\\'m not that old yet.\" Speaking about the original soundtrack, Stay Alive, that he produced for the webtoon 7 Fates Chakho, Suga asked the feedback of his viewers. As translated by Twitter user @BTStranslation_ Yoongi spoke about both the tracks--Stay Alive and Girl of My Dreams, revealing that he wrote the lyrics for the songs on the flight to the US. He also said he recorded Girl of My Dreams almost as soon as he landed there. Suga then spoke about the lyrics of Stay Alive and also about Jungkook who sang the song. \"I wrote the lyrics for Stay Alive with keeping the webtoon in mind. Jungkook recorded the song so well. The chorus was so high but he didn\\'t even do a re-recording, it was approved at once. He\\'s a person overflowing with talent.\" When a fan asked if Suga was working on Stay Alive in In The Soop, he replied, \"Yes right. But at the time Jungkook\\'s melody was not put in the song. It\\'s the one I was working on in In The Soop.\" Suga also promised ARMY that he will hold a live session on his birthday, which is on March 9. \"It\\'s my birthday soon, I\\'ll see you guys on my birthday. I\\'ll come live again on my birthday,\" he said. When asked what he planned to do on his special day, Suga replied, \"What will I do on my birthday? The day after is concert day so I don\\'t think I can do much (laughed).\" BTS will hold three concerts in Seoul this month. The BTS Permission To Dance On Stage-Seoul is scheduled on March 10, 12 and 13. The BTS member also spoke about their home concert next week, \"The concert is going to be very fun. We\\'re preparing hard. We\\'ve been looking forward to a concert in Korea. It will still be quite chilly in March so I\\'m trying not to get sick.\" About their Las Vegas concert, Suga said, \"I\\'m excited for the Vegas concert too, the renewed venue. The stadium itself looked so cool, we saw it while passing by.\" The dates of the concerts are April 8, 9, 15 and 16. When a fan teased him saying Bangtan (BTS) is so lucky they can go to Bangtan concert, Suga laughed and said, \"Haha, they (we) go every time.\" A fan wrote, \"If I can\\'t go to the concert I\\'ll die\", Suga responded laughing, \"It\\'s not like that. You can watch it online too.\" When he asked ARMY to not get \\'too nervous\\' during ticketing and be calm, a fan said, \"Is there a way not to get nervous (about ticketing)?\" He replied, \"Just do it as you normally would. Like when you\\'re choosing from a menu.\" The BTS members--RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook last December debuted on Instagram. Speaking about his feed, Suga said, \"I don\\'t know what pictures to upload on Instagram. I don\\'t know how to make my feed look pretty, either. I normally don\\'t take pictures. I\\'m still not sure what this \\'Instagram vibe\\' is all about.\" Suga who recently recovered from Covid-19, said, \"My condition is all better now. It\\'s been like three months since I contracted it (Covid-19). People don\\'t always catch it cause they didn\\'t take care. No one wants to contract it on purpose. It\\'s not your fault.\" Suga also replied when asked if his pet Holly still walks all over him, \"Yes. When I get home he comes with his clothes held in his mouth like let\\'s go on a walk. He\\'s sleeping right next to me every day.\"',\n",

       " \"BLACKPINK members are now busy promoting their album Pink Venom. They are in the US. The girls went on the Jimmy Kimmel show where they did a live performance of the song. It seems Rose outdid herself with her moves and amazing vocals. Now, the host said that 'kids' were super excited to see BLACKPINK on the Kimmel stage. This has not gone down well with K-Pop fans. It is a known fact that the popular groups have fans across age groups and ethnicities. Some time back, James Corden referred to BTS fans as 15-year-old fangirls and ARMY did not take it lightly at all. In fact, the host apologized to RM aka Kim Namjoon when they came on the show during the LA Concert promotions Now, Kim Jisoo had to miss the 2022 Seoul Drama Awards to be present for the promotions of Pink Venom. She was awarded the Best Actress for Snowdrop. Blinks and solo fans of Jisoo are upset that she had to miss out because of Jimmy Kimmel. Some have even termed the performance as boring. They feel YG Entertainment should have done better with the promotions of Pink Venom. Snowdrop saw a heartfelt performance from Kim Jisoo. This was her acting debut Jisoo's vocals have also got praise in the Blackpink comeback. The singer is seen as the eldest sister of the group, and has been their emotional anchor. Kim Jisoo won at the fan voted event. Even Kim Seon-Ho who is world famous for his poignant acting in Hometown Cha Cha won an award\",\n",

       " \"BTS and tales of their sasaeng fans are well-known. Now, one incident has been reported where a former sasaeng fan of the septet from Japan revealed how her obsession affected her life. It seems she was recruited by a Korean sasaeng who had told her to follow the band, and find out if Jungkook was dating someone or not. Koreaboo has revealed an incident which has been narrated on a YouTube channel Kisses Dahlia. A Japanese fan has said that she became a K-Pop fan in 2017, and BTS was her fave It seems she became famous because of the high quality pics that she took when she went to their concerts. This led to her being approached by a Korean sasaeng. She was given a 'job' to spy on the boys and take their pics. It seems she took up the offer because she needed the money. However, the sasaeng culture is very exhausting and found it worrying when she started enjoying the act of spying on the boys. The fan has said that her sister found out that she is a sasaeng and sent her for therapy. The girl has said that she is regretful of her actions and understands how sasaeng culture is harmful Even today Jimin said that some fans were calling him when he was doing his VLive with J-Hope after the Lollapalooza Festival. Fans wondered if they were sasaengs who were troubling the boys. We also remember how Jungkook kept getting calls in the middle of the night as he did a VLive chat during the Las Vegas tour. Sasaengs have been known to book tickets in same flights as the boys due to which they stopped taking commercial flights. Once, a sasaeng tried to kiss SUGA but was held by the bodyguard\",\n",
       " \"One of the attention-grabbing things in BTS ARMY and Blink's life is the dating rumour between Kim Taehyung and Jennie Kim. It doesn't seem to die down and the fandoms have been arguing forever now! Both the artists BTS V and Jennie have kept mum and their dating rumours. Talking about the dating rumours, every day there are images surfacing, going viral and circulated online, claiming to be leaked images as proof of Taehyung and Jennie's relationship. There has been no confirmation about the same, but the one leaking the images claims that everything is real. An HD pic seems to have surfaced now So, yesterday, V aka Kim Taehyung shared a video with Yeontan. It was a cute and the most adorable video wherein BTS V made Yeontan play with him before giving him his treat. After the video was shared, an old picture shared by Gurumi Haribo resurfaced and allegedly in an HD format. The picture is cut at the upper side where Jennie's picture is seen. The picture claims to be a video call between the two artists ARMYs and Blinks have previously called out the pictures as fake and edited. Even before the pics have been called out as fake wherein the ARMYs dissected the editing skills of the photo editor and the one who leaked them. And now, they have again slammed the edited picture saying that the whole door has been edited out in the new image It’s been weeks since Kim Taehyung and Jennie have been linked together. Earlier the agencies YG Entertainment and HYBE aka Big Hit released vague statements about edited pictures without addressing the alleged affair. BTS V's pet pooch, Yeontan, has been dragged into their rumoured affair previously. A picture alleged to be clicked by Jennie was shared stating that she clicked the picture of Yeontan\",\n",
       " 'At the concert, fans were seen holding placards that read, \"We want to focus on...\" next to a picture of Jungkook raising his iconic black blazer flashing his abs. Jungkook lifted his T-shirt and showed off his abs. As ARMY cheered, Jungkook was seen laughing and giggling. BTS member Jimin was seen in a black jacket and pants. He opted not to wear the jacket and wore a chain around his neck. For the concert, Jimin opted to appear with short hair. He was seen with long hair in his last concerts. At the concert, RM said, \"I know there\\'s a lot of noise out there about the Grammys, but you know, why give a s*** about it? Hating is their freedom, and they have their right to hate, but if it was me, I\\'d rather just talk with my friends in some cafe and then forget about it. Rather than tweeting about it or some interview. I won\\'t do that because I\\'m a grown up. But anyway, we didn\\'t come to Vegas for the Grammys, we came to Vegas for the ARMYs!\" He also said, \"The records, the titles, the accomplishments, the trophies, they\\'re really important, but that wasn\\'t the first thing, the first reason why we started all these things. These two hours communion, energy, eye to eye, singing along, dancing together, this communication, this is everything. This is why we\\'re doing this right? I hope you know it. I love you. Let the haters hate, let the lovers love. Peace!\" J-Hope, as translated by Twitter user @jhopestudio, said, \"There’s nothing holding us back, no one can stop us now.\" At the start of the BTS concert, the show was delayed due to technical difficulties. Speaking about it, V said, \"We had trouble with the screen earlier and I was thinking \\'ahh s***** (expletive in Korean)\\'.” While translating, the translator said, \"We had trouble with the screen earlier and I was thinking \\'oh shoot\\'.\" V quickly corrected him, \"It’s not ‘shoot\\' though.” The translator said \"s***”.
