Struggling with every move:
Member Jin finds himself calling out for the trainer with cries of help as he takes on flying yoga  SUGA who has to be careful with his shoulder can also be seen screaming out in trouble over the many complex actions  Last but surely not the least, the most surprising revelation is dance leader J-Hope who learns that this is definitely not his cup of tea as he adorably maneuvers every move with wonder on his face and flailing limbs

Which is your favorite moment? Let us know in the comments below &nbsp;

BTS members RM, Jin, V, and Jungkook featured in a new Bangtan Bomb video from last year when they performed at The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The video was dropped on Bangtan TV's YouTube channel on Wednesday. It showed the members recording their dance performances to their tracks Butter and Dynamite for the show. Titled BTS’s Chaotic Break Time, the video started with Jungkook giving an update about the members. "We just finished Dynamite and Butter. We're recording it but the song (Butter) hasn't been released yet. It hasn't hit me yet. Until it's really released we'll keep preparing and practising whenever we have time." As Jungkook spoke, V stood behind him giving directions to Jin on what to say on camera. At first, Jin spoke about his appearance in the song, "It's not that I opened the performance fancy. I just stood up and walked. If that looked fancy all I could say is that my face was fancy." Jin then burst out laughing and said, "Our members are listening to this through the mic so it's a bit embarrassing." While talking, Jin kept on shifting his glances at the camera and V. He then showed a finger heart revealing that V asked him to do so. Speaking about V, Jin said, "He said to say something to the camera. He told me to say ‘Please look forward to it’." As V continued giving instructions on the mic set, Jin obediently repeated it in the camera, "He said he loves ARMY. He said he can't wait to hold a concert." Following this, RM became the next member to feature in the clip. As soon as he showed up, Jin and V joined him and they started interrupting each other's interviews. RM started with, "Hello. Welcome to the first day of our Butter promotion. I sincerely..." However, he was cut off by V saying, "You have nose hair." As RM moved away, V said in the camera, "Hello ARMY, I'm Kin Taehyung." Here Jin said, "You have mouth hair." V walked away and Jin said, "Hello everyone. This is Jin." But V interrupted saying, "You have armpit hair." As he started talking facing the camera, RM came and said, "You have eye hair." Smiling at the camera, RM said, "It's s nice to meet you guys." As V walked into the frame asking RM, "You got neck hair?", Jin told the group leader, "You look handsome today." Finally, Jin was able to say, "Hello. I'm Jin. What we're doing today is recording Butter. It's very awkward since no one's pushing their way in. Fighting!" Next on V's target was Jungkook. As the youngest member said, "We'll continue to show you good performances" V pushed him out of the frame saying, "Outta my way." As the video ended, V said, "Everyone, please look forward to it." Last year, BTS members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook had to participate in a skit for The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Butter released in May last year and clinched the top spot of the Billboard Hot 100 for nine consecutive weeks. The song also broke several records including Most Viewers for the Premiere of a Music Video on YouTube, Most Viewers for the Premiere of a Video on YouTube, Most-viewed YouTube Music Video in 24 hours by a K-pop group and Most Viewed YouTube Music Video in 24 hours.

The official Twitter handle of BTS shared a series of pictures from the event. Speaking to the audience at the festival, J-Hope said, "I pour my heart and soul into my music. Even if we speak different languages, I hope you listen to my story." BTS fandom ARMY took to Twitter and showered love on J-Hope for his performance. A fan wrote, "Goosebumps. Thank you J-Hope." "J-Hope owned it. I'm just at home but I felt like I attended personally I'm sweating, screaming," said another fan. "You have just witnessed the legendary artist Jung Hoseok make history. #HOBIPALOOZA," tweeted another fan. After his electrifying performance, J-Hope held a live session on V Live which was also joined by Jimin. Speaking to the fans, J-Hope said, "The process of this album that began from desire and childish ambitiousness, we're moving magnificently towards the finale of one of the processes. Through this album, all the schedules became my blood and flesh (part of me) and while looking at you all and our ARMY & the public while (performing in) Lollapalooza today, once again I think another determination and definite faith has formed." Speaking about Jimin, J-Hope said, "Since the moment he came, I've had the smile flower bloomed on me. I was really into the process as you felt when you came here, it was a world of darkness, you came and became my light. You entered like 'J-Hope-the light'." Jimin complimented J-Hope's performance and dedication. "He really has been working so hard.. like not eating at the time, even losing weight, working in the absolute dark— like even I like dark places but it was really too dark? Did you guys see the dynamite dance? I feel like we should change the main choreography." On his time on stage at the event, J-Hope said, "Honestly it was nine songs originally but it became 10. I think the run time went over one hour." Jimin replied, "We couldn't tell, it went by quickly" and J-Hope added, "Maybe cause I didn't say endments, it went by quickly." As the live ended, Jimin told ARMY that J-Hope 'didn't even sleep properly in anticipation and the rapper replied, "I couldn't sleep more than three hours."

BLACKPINK members are now busy promoting their album Pink Venom. They are in the US. The girls went on the Jimmy Kimmel show where they did a live performance of the song. It seems Rose outdid herself with her moves and amazing vocals. Now, the host said that 'kids' were super excited to see BLACKPINK on the Kimmel stage. This has not gone down well with K-Pop fans. It is a known fact that the popular groups have fans across age groups and ethnicities. Some time back, James Corden referred to BTS fans as 15-year-old fangirls and ARMY did not take it lightly at all. In fact, the host apologized to RM aka Kim Namjoon when they came on the show during the LA Concert promotions Now, Kim Jisoo had to miss the 2022 Seoul Drama Awards to be present for the promotions of Pink Venom. She was awarded the Best Actress for Snowdrop. Blinks and solo fans of Jisoo are upset that she had to miss out because of Jimmy Kimmel. Some have even termed the performance as boring. They feel YG Entertainment should have done better with the promotions of Pink Venom. Snowdrop saw a heartfelt performance from Kim Jisoo. This was her acting debut Jisoo's vocals have also got praise in the Blackpink comeback. The singer is seen as the eldest sister of the group, and has been their emotional anchor. Kim Jisoo won at the fan voted event. Even Kim Seon-Ho who is world famous for his poignant acting in Hometown Cha Cha won an award
After the performance, BTS interacted with the drummer-rapper who said that their track Yet To Come reminds him of church and called it 'fantastic'. Anderson also spoke a few words in Korean. He also revealed, "It was my son because he's a big fan, he made me a fan. I've been obsessed, I've been ARMY ever since." They also spoke about attending each other's concerts and complimented them. After the rapper left, the members spoke about their 'best moments so far' in their careers. J-Hope said that it was the day BTS was born, June 13, 2013, while Jimin recalled it as the day when BTS had their solo concert in 2014. Suga said for him, it was BTS' showcase day on June 12, 2013, "I still remember the basement floor at the King Kong building, Ilchi Art Hall." RM said that when BTS had their first concert at the Olympic Gymnastic Arena, it was his 'best moment'. V said, "For me, it was those days when Jungkook would cry if I asked, 'Are you crying?' That was the best moment for me." The other members teased him. Jungkook recalled that the day he joined BTS was his 'best moment'. "I believe BTS wouldn't exist without me. I'm sorry that was a joke," he said. Jin credited all the moments so far as his 'best moment'. BTS members next spoke about their journey since Covid-19 in 2020 during which 'a lot of things changed' for them and the ARMY. RM said, "Most of the things we've done since 2020 weren't planned in advance. None of it was planned." Suga added, "Nothing went as planned." RM continued, "As we went on we were sometimes a little afraid and unsure if we were on the right path. We've also had growing reservations about what was the right answer." Jimin said, "We thought the pandemic would be over soon...but none of us thought that it would take more than two years." Suga said, "We're like 'Let's give it three months. We'll be able to have a concert in three months'." Jungkook added that it was then the group came out with their song Dynamite as it was their 'way of braving the Covid-19 pandemic'. They also spoke about their album BE, songs Butter and Permission to Dance and their concerts. Speaking about Proof, V said, "If you look closely many of our unreleased songs are included in this album. We took those songs as a chance to reminisce on when they were recorded. We also wanted to wrap up our first chapter, that's why we created our album." Suga added, "When I grow interested in an artist, it's hard to listen to all their albums. This album is like the essence. Once you follow this guide, you'll get a rough idea of who BTS is. It's like a textbook or a guidebook you can show to beginners." Last week BTS released Proof via BigHit Music. The album, comprising three discs, is a look back on the group's journey in the last near decade. The songs in the album comprise the members' personal selections from their old tracks. It is a gift to ARMY and also features a brand-new single Yet to Come (The Most Beautiful Moment), Run BTS, and For Youth.
During the episode, the members took a trip down memory lane as they visited their dorms, spoke about eating icecreams, visiting a particular restaurant and taking walks near their dorm. They also recalled the famous dumpling incident (involving a heated argument between Jimin and V) and the banana incident (when Jungkook noticed fruits disappearing from the fruit basket ARMY gave him. At that time, Jungkook argued saying it was his and J-Hope got angry, threw a banana at him and said, 'You eat it all'). While taking a walk near their dorm, RM recalled how the members walked on the street every day during the initial days of their career. He also said how he and V got caught while having ice cream. Recalling the exact spot, RM said, “I got caught exactly around here. I took the ice cream cone and stuffed it in my pocket. He (the person) asked where we were going, so we just said, 'Back to our dorm'. In the end, the ice cream melted in my pocket, but I didn't want to waste it. So I took it off and ate it again.” While RM and Jimin took a walk, Jin and V feasted on Jajangmyeon (Korean noodle dish). Suga sat in his car outside the restaurant that the members frequented earlier. The members tried to figure out each other's locations as they travelled in their cars around the city. By round two, Jungkook joined RM, Jin, Jimin, and V. Suga also met J-Hope near their old dorm and screamed 'my friend' from his car. All the members met at the Jamwon Han River Park and hugged each other. For a few moments, they forgot about filming and huddled together asking each other where they first went. The crew had to interrupt asking them to face the camera. In the last round, the members were given the keyword, ARMY. Though they were together, they could not discuss which place they would go to separately. RM kept hinting to J-Hope, "We can go back to a place we've been already." He suggested the Olympic Stadium. All the members were seen heading to the venue except V who chose the first showcase venue of BTS. He said, "I'll ask ARMY if it should be the first concert or first showcase." However, he got shy and couldn't ask anyone despite making several attempts in Garosu-gil. The video ended with all of them meeting for lunch during which the members discussed on what to do next. RM suggested 'getting middle-aged men from just around neighbourhood and playing 7-7 volleyball'. Jungkook suggested they learn Sepak takraw, a game, Jin asked about farming, and Suga came up with the idea of racing. Jimin said, " I want to try pole dancing too." RM added, "That suits you though." The video ended with V goofily saying, "Run BTS will continue running."
It was recently that BTS members launched their special clothing line called Artist Made Collection. The septet - RM, Jin, Jungkook, Jimin, V, Suga and J-Hope designed the clothes on their own and they even turned models to promote each other's designs. Now, BTS' longtime manager Hobum Song was sported wearing pajamas designed by Jin. Hobum Song and Jin are said to have a special connect as they are said to be each other's favourite. If one can recalls, Jin had used Hobum Song's shoulders to hide when went all shy as he recieved praises. The manager took to his Instagram account to share pictures wearing the pajamas and ARMY was instantly reminded of Hobum Song and Jin's bond The Bangtan Boys had even attended the manager's wedding and performed on their song DNA. In Hobum Song's wedding album, there is a picture of BTS boys enjoying themselves to the fullest
BTS, who are preparing to release a new album next month, is planning to skip the Billboard Music Awards this year due to their packed schedule  This comes despite the fact that the K-pop group made history by securing the highest number of nominations by a K-pop group at the award show  ARMY might not be able to watch a performance by the band at BBMA, but they are still low-key happy about it  Also Read| BTS reveals title and cover of Proof's lead single; ARMY solves mystery from seven years ago: 'HYYH era is back'BTS members RM, Suga, V, Jin, Jimin, J-Hope, and Jungkook were in Las Vegas last month for their four-day Permission to Dance on Stage concert  However, they have decided not to return to the city this month for the BBMA on May 15 As per Allkpop, this is because the band is currently focusing on their new album Proof, due to come out on June 10  They will not be attending any award show until then and will give their acceptance speech with a video if they win The K-pop group fans, collectively known as ARMY, supported their decision and also said that they are even happy about it  In BTS' last Billboard interview, the ARMY was indirectly accused of manipulating the charts in their favour by mass-buying their songs  This came after their English song Butter, released in May 2021, became the longest-ranking no 1 song on Billboard Hot 100 chart after topping it for 10 weeks In response, RM had defended the ARMY and suggested that it's up to Billboard to change the rules and base the ranking on streaming  Billboard later changed the rules of their digital sales, making it harder for fans to purchase their favourite artists' music and support them, further angering the ARMY BTS fans are still fuming at Billboard for it  One wrote on Twitter, "Honestly I’m so glad to hear that they decided to not attend this year  Their comeback is far more important than the BBMAs anyways," while another commented, "I'm low-key happy that they are not attending BB will not get that clout it was wishing for but my second persona is thinking abt the performance we would have got " A third one wrote, "I support their decision  Literally after what BB keep doing they don't deserve BTS at all "In 2017, BTS became the first K-pop group to be nominated for and win a Billboard Award, and have won an award every year since then  This year, the band has been nominated seven times in six categories for their songs Butter and Permission To Dance at the Billboard Music Awards 2022 They have been nominated in the categories Top Duo/Group, Top Song Sales Artist, Top Billboard Global (Excl  U S ) Artist, Top Selling Song (in which they were nominated twice), Top Billboard Global (Excl  U S ) Song and Top Rock Song (which they share with Coldplay for “My Universe”)  This marks the highest number of nominations that any group or duo has received in any year

The newest episode of Run BTS dropped on Weverse, VLIVE and YouTube dropped a couple of hours ago. Run BTS is officially back!

In the second episode of BTS X Manito, they play the game of Bingo based on food items on their bingo chart. The members have to act out the food items and the others have to guess the answer and tick off the list. These two are by far the most hilarious episodes of Run BTS In this episode of Run BTS, we saw the epic whisper challenge game where Jin aka Kim Seokjin showcased his amazing telepathic abilities and Jimin introduced us to La Chi Mo La La Not that the VR game part 1 is not that fun but the Part 2 of VR games played by the Bangtan Boys was more fun. J-Hope was the funniest especially when she dropped from the high rise. Taetae's swag to Jungkook being the pro at playing games was a sight for ARMYs BTS ARMY, if you want to have a good laugh while watching Run BTS episodes these two are great for laughter packs. It was in the second episode of Summer Outing that the boys had to fight with Jungkook and he still won the game. Jungkook is quite agile The Bangtan Boys - RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook played some fun games whilst in Pajamas. The most fun part was chimchim aka Park Jimin's sketches on socks to guess the word by drawing. Guess who was the artist of the episode at that time? In this episode, the Bangtan Boys played games that they played in the past. Taehyung's memory power left the members speechless. The Rapline and the vocal line had been divided into two groups and the Rap line was at their hilarious best. The second episode also saw the return of the photo booth In these two episodes of Run BTS, we saw the Bangtan Boys getting missions. Hidden between them was a spy. The missions were to click photos with the rest of the members based on certain themes. However, when the soy was revealed, the Bangtan Boys felt the shock of their lives The 77-minute Debate episodes are the funniest of the lot. The boys were divided into two teams and had to debate about foods and everything under the sun which makes them the goofiest. The main factor here is the water shower based on the banned word. Jungkook, Jimin and other Bangtan Boys when learned the banned words they used them to trouble the judge in the centre. It was laughter riots of the two episodes Meanwhile, the latest episode of Run BTS featured the Bangtan Boys – RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook playing the game of telepathy and revealing how much they still know about each others' thoughts and ways of doing things
BTS consists of members Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook&mdash;co-writes and co-produces much of their own material. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to incorporate a wide range of genres; their lyrics have often discussed mental health, the troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards self-love, and individualism. Their work also frequently references literature, philosophy and psychological concepts, and includes an alternate universe storyline.

BTS in the beginning:&nbsp;

After launching in 2013 with their single album 2 Cool 4 Skool, BTS respectively released their first Korean-language studio album, Dark &amp; Wild, and Japanese-language studio album, Wake Up, in 2014. The group&#39;s second Korean studio album, Wings (2016), was their first to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS had crossed into the global music market, leading the Korean wave into the United States and breaking several sales records. They became the first Korean ensemble to receive a Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for their single Mic Drop, as well as the first act from South Korea to top the Billboard 200 with their studio album Love Yourself: Tear (2018).&nbsp;

BTS&#39; achievements:&nbsp;

BTS became one of the few groups since the Beatles in 1966&ndash;1968 with four US number-one albums in less than two years, and Love Yourself: Answer (2018) was the first Korean album certified Platinum by the RIAA. In 2020, BTS became the first all-South Korean act to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard Global 200 with their Grammy-nominated single Dynamite. Their follow-up releases Savage Love, Life Goes On, Butter, and Permission to Dance made them the quickest act to earn four US number-one singles since Justin Timberlake in 2006.

BTS in 2022:

As of 2022, BTS is the best-selling artist in South Korean history, having sold in excess of 30 million albums via the Circle Chart, and their studio album Map of the Soul: 7 (2020) is the best-selling album of all time in South Korea. They are the first non-English-speaking and Asian act to hold sold-out concerts at Wembley Stadium and the Rose Bowl (Love Yourself World Tour in 2019), and were named the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry&#39;s (IFPI) Global Recording Artist of the Year for both 2020 and 2021.

The video started with Suga practising the choreography of That That. After teaching the rapper a few steps, the choreographers said that he 'learns fast'. Suga laughed and said, "Then we can work on the details. I'm not too confident. I just memorise quickly." After learning some more dance steps, Suga said laughing, "I knew it. I knew it wouldn't be easy. I was practising for the concert." At one point during their practice, Suga got curious and asked the choreographer, "Are you a leftie? We normally start with the right hand. You started everything with the left hand. So I thought you were a leftie." As the video continued, Suga practised and said, "If I think about something else for a moment. I miss it." One of the choreographers again told Suga that 'he's learning fast'. The rapper laughed and said, "I'm an idol after all," to which they all laughed and agreed. Suga also practised with PSY and the entire team of That That. During their break, Suga asked PSY, "Don't you shoot part by part?" PSY replied, "You don't think I have the stamina?" As PSY teased Suga, the latter laughed. As the video ended, Suga said, "It's harder than our recent choreography. I'm so exhausted. The choreography I didn't think it'd be this hard. I should do well tomorrow." Suga, PSY and their team seemingly filmed the music video of That That the next day. That That celebrates the end of the Covid-19 pandemic, and things going back to normal. In the song, both Suga and PSY featured in cowboy outfits in the middle of a desert. That That is part of PSY's latest album PSY 9th. Meanwhile, BTS members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook are awaiting the release of their upcoming anthology album Proof. It will release on June 10.

BTS members Jimin and V featured in a new Bangtan Bomb video. The clip, which was released on Tuesday on Bangtan TV's YouTube channel, showed them recall how they interacted with fans on camera after they debuted with RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope and Jungkook in 2013. The video started with BTS' Jimin and V warming up using a chair before shooting for their track Butter last year. As Jimin lifted the chair over his head, V told him, "You've to straighten your arms." He replied, "I can't go any higher because of the jacket. Here's the limit (as he showed how far he can lift the chair above him)." As their staff worked around them, they continued their exercise smiling. Next, Jimin came to the camera as he covered nearly the entire lens. He said, "Now we only have one last shooting left." V peered over his shoulder and asked what he was doing and if he was having fun. Jimin responded by laughing, "It's what we used to do when we debuted. We used to do this a lot when we debuted. We'd get greedy and want to show more for our fans." Jimin then added, "We are talking now." Pointing at V, he said, "He used to do this a lot." V added, "It's true that I used to say things like that." The video ended with Jimin and V talking in 'sim' language, as the caption read, all the while laughing and pulling each other's legs. All the BTS members, who are on an 'extended period of rest', are gearing up for their upcoming concerts in Seoul next month. This will be BTS' first show for th live audience in Seoul since the coronavirus pandemic began. The concerts, Permission to Dance on Stage-Seoul, will take place at Seoul's Olympic Stadium on March 10, 12 and 13, and will also be live-streamed, the group's agency Bit Hit Music had said. Their last concert for South Korean fans was in October 2019, a couple of months before the coronavirus began. As the pandemic spread in 2020, the band postponed and then called off their international tour involving nearly 40 concerts. They held some online shows instead. BTS debuted in 2013 and have produced many songs over the years. In November last year, they created history by becoming the first Asian artists to win the top prize at the American Music Awards. They played their first in-person concerts since the onset of the pandemic in November, in Los Angles. The pandemic also affected a few members--RM, Jin, Suga, Jimin and V, as they contracted the coronavirus. However, all of them have fully recovered.
Recently, Jungkook along with the other group members RM, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, and V held a live session on V Live. However, Jin wasn't present with them as he underwent surgery for his finger injury. During the live, a fan asked, "What happened to Jungkook’s shirt during Fake Love?" At this, Suga asked if the button really popped off and Jungkook replied, as translated by Twitter user @btsbaragi_jk, "It got unbuttoned." The other members started teasing him. Suga asked, "You didn’t do that on purpose?" Jimin said, "You seemed to be continuously laughing and smiling as you performed." RM said, "I saw him before we went in (on stage) and he was pulling it off (at the thread) a lot." Jungkook said, "The reason I laughed is because I buttoned it up once but it got undone again so I was dumbfounded." Suga reminded RM that previously he had once accidentally ripped off Jungkook's buttons. To this Jungkook, added, "I did give it a thought. Since its already unbuttoned, should I unbutton another one? Should I just completely unbutton it?’" V chimed in saying, "I think it would be nice if you performed by taking it off one day." Jungkook replied, "No, not for me. I’m not ready yet." Jimin added, "As far as I know, at the time, the fans couldn’t hold back their cheers and a sound came out of their mouths." He was speaking of the time during the concert when Jungkook's blazer got unbuttoned. Suga asked Jungkook, "I heard you went in after putting in on oil on day three." While RM and J-Hope laughed, Jungkook said, "But I always do that since I have to show my abs. Always have to be prepared." Speaking about Jin, Suga said that he is taking rest and Jimin added that he is recovering well. RM said, "Don't worry too much, you guys, he said he's okay. The surgery was short and he's okay honestly." The live saw Jin's representative, BT21 character RJ's soft toy. Referring to it, Jungkook said, "That's why this friend came (RJ). Jimin said, "Jin hyung (brother) told us to convey his greeting to you guys. We saw him today" and RM added, "On seeing him, he was doing fine." Next, their conversation steered towards their Instagram accounts. Suga asked J-Hope if he has deleted all his Instagram photos. J-Hope replied, "No. I moved a couple over to archive. I didn't delete it. I moved them to the archive. Turns out you can bring them back later. I searched about it." Jimin also spoke on why he doesn't share posts on Instagram regularly. He said, "With Instagram, I can’t go on it because I’m scared I might press something wrong." As RM urged him to share posts he said he will. The members concluded the session by saying that they will hold another live in Las Vegas. BTS will perform in Las Vegas' Allegiant Stadium on April 8, April 9, April 15, and April 16.
Jay Park took to his Instagram account on Tuesday to share pictures from his recent meeting with Jungkook, and showered the K-pop star with praises. The first picture was a selfie in which Jungkook pouted as he kept his arm around Jay Park, who flashed a huge smile. In the second picture, both of them posed against a music workstation. Sharing the pictures, Jay wrote, “Even though he’s at the top, he has a growth mindset and he’s humble. What a stud… Plus he’s good at boxing… After I met Jk I can definitely see why they get so much love. Humble, [ambitious] and talented." Jungkook shared the post on his Instagram Stories. The post soon received several comments from fans asking if Jungkook is planning to collaborate with the American rapper, who was previously a part of K-pop group 2PM. Many fans commented "OMG," with one writing, "Are they making music together?? Collab?" Another commented, "Right now I will start praying that they make a song together, out of Jungkook's comfort zone, something Jay Park style." However, a large section of ARMY was not happy about the meeting and took to Twitter to say that they cannot forgive Jay Park. The Seattle-based rapper had risen to fame as the leader of the South Korean boy band 2PM in 2008. But he left the band and South Korea and returned home the next year following a major controversy when the comments he wrote about Korea in 2005 as a teenager were publicised by the Korean media. In addition, he had also previously criticised BTS in several tweets. He wrote in one such tweet in 2018, “Two ppl on the plane asked me if I was part of BTS … lol I need to get my weight up." ARMY cited these tweets as they suggested that Jungkook is posing with him because he is being held hostage. "Free Jungkook of Jay Park," one wrote, while another commented, "Free Jungkook. he only did what he had to do he didn’t mean it #jkheldhostage #jkhostagesituation." A third one wrote, "Jungkook prolly the nicest person on earth i know damn well that mf had a gun on the other side forcing him to take a selfie ! praying jungkook got home safely without finding out he lost his wallet #freejungkook." Another commented, "Jay Park the biggest hypocrite ever because he acted like he didn't shade BTS and ARMYS in the past but now he's all smiling and acting like a saint." Meanwhile, BTS members Jungkook, Jin, Jimin, J-Hope, Suga, and V have returned to South Korea after their Permission to Dance concert in Las Vegas. Group leader RM was not spotted with them during their arrival at Seoul airport on Tuesday.
The video started with Jimin sitting in his car on his way to the shop. He said, "I've always wanted to go to a workshop and make jewellery. I've always wanted to try it. You all know that I like jewellery. So I thought I could go and make some simple bracelets for today. So that's where I'm going right now." He also said, "I got my wisdom tooth pulled out. After I got my wisdom tooth out I ate more and gained weight. I'm about 64.7 kg right now. I'm gonna make jewellery and go on a diet." At the workshop, Jimin worked on making the jewellery. However, he broke the blade of the saw, he was working with, twice. He said, "I'm so sorry. I just broke the last one and broke it again. I'm very sorry." After getting the second replacement of the blade Jimin said, "Please last this time." After sawing, Jimin filed the metal and continued with the process to make the bracelet. As he hammered a metal piece, he asked the people, "Don't I look like an employee here? Are you here to pick up a project? What if I become your best apprentice?" Jimin continued working on the jewellery and said, "It feels so exciting. This is fun. So much effort goes into this." Jimin, after finishing making the bracelets, said, "I'll wear one on each wrist. It went faster than I expected." Wearing them he showed it to the camera and said, "These are the nice bracelets I made. I'm so satisfied and had so much fun. The hammering was especially fun for me. The shaping process was fun. The sawing part was the hardest. It was so fun. If ARMY wants to try this kind of hobby too or if you want to make something valuable for yourself in a quiet place, it'll be fun to go to a workshop like this." Bangtan TV has been sharing videos featuring the vlogs of BTS members every week. So far V shared his vlog where he had meals with his crew, played golf and travelled around the city. In J-Hope's vlog, he gave a glimpse of the shooting of his latest album, Jack in the Box. The vlogs of RM, Jin, Suga, and Jungkook are yet to be released.
Soloist Sunmi has taken over the program &lsquo;Showterview&rsquo; as its new host and the show continues to be a favourite spot for fellow celebrities in the Korean entertainment industry to visit and have a good time with her  In the past, boy group ATEEZ, Hyolyn, Alexa as well as Single&rsquo;s Inferno cast member as well as Sunmi&rsquo;s backup dancer Cha Hyun Seung have made for meaningful guests 

In this week&rsquo;s episode, it was flamboyance queen and hitmaker soloist CHUNG HA who was invited and it was just as chaotic as one would expect as the close friends talked about everything  While sitting on the floor and cracking open some snacks to chew on to, they reminisced about the many moments that strengthened their friendship 

From their first meet at their shared salon, to when they went viral because of their many funny moments  One of these incidents was when they sat beside each other in the artists section of the 2018 Mnet Asian Music Awards  As V returned to join the rest of the BTS members, there was not enough room for him and so he decided to grab a seat in front of them  Looking at this, CHUNG HA and Sunmi who were beside leader RM got up to offer their spot to V who gratefully accepted it 

The scene has since gone viral among the BTS ARMY who have been equally thankful for their kind gesture when K-pop idols are known to minimize their interaction to avoid rumors  The two were happy to receive praise from the fans of other artists  Check out their full discussion below

BTS also held its first free concert in Busan in October. For this show, BTS appeared 'without any additional fee' and HYBE invested their personal funds for the concert. 2) BTS members at Grammy's: The seven members performed at the 64th Grammy Awards in April, their first in-person performance for which they received a standing ovation. Just ahead of the show, BTS members contracted Covid-19 and Jin could partially perform due to his surgery. The performance saw the members pulling off a museum heist on their single Butter. 3) BTS 'on a break': Fans were left shocked and heartbroken when during the Festa dinner the group announced a 'hiatus'. Suga had said in a video during the dinner as per the English subtitles, “So we’ve entered an off-season. We’re going into a hiatus now.” He later added, “It’s not like we’re disbanding. We should live doing what we want to do...Writing lyrics is the hardest. What message do we want to give? Nothing comes out anymore." Later, AP quoted BigHit's clarification, “BTS are not taking a hiatus. Members will be focusing more on solo projects at this time." RM and Jungkook also issued clarifications that they will not go on a hiatus. 4) BTS album Proof: The group released their anthology album Proof in June. The album is a 3-CD collection of BTS’ hit old as well as new songs. Proof included three new songs--Yet to Come, Run BTS, and Born Singer. Their old hits I Need You, Run, Fire, Fake Love, Persona, Moon, are also part of the album. It released a few days before their ninth debut anniversary, on June 10. 5) BTS at the White House: The group attended the White House Press briefing in May to discuss anti-Asian hate crimes. They made history as they had a private meeting with US President Joe Biden at the White House for the first time ever. They were invited to the White House in celebration of Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders Heritage Month (AANHPI Heritage Month). The US President surprised the members by playing Butter in the Oval Office before their discussion to make them 'feel at home'. 6) BTS military enlistment: South Korea has a rule of mandatory military service for able-bodied men by 28. K-pop stars are granted the ability to defer their enrolment until 30. BTS ARMY has always dreaded the time when the members will have to spend months in the military. This year, in October, BigHit Music announced that military enlistment will begin with the eldest member Jin. All the other members--RM, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V aka Kim Taehyung and Jungkook will follow him. The group will reconvene in 2025. Though fans wished them well, the news left them emotional. Apart from these, BTS also made a comeback with their variety show, RUN BTS, after 10 months. Fans saw the members doing solo projects with Jimin singing With You for K-drama Our Blues, Suga produced and featured in That That with PSY, Suga and Jungkook came out with Stay Alive, and Jungkook treated fans to My You. The collaborations continued with Jungkook and Charlie Puth's Left and Right, J-Hope and Crush's Rush Hour, and Jin and Coldplay's Astronaut. While J-Hope released his first album Jack in the Box and performed at the Lollapalooza, RM too unveiled his first album Indigo. Jungkook became the first Asian artist to perform at the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar.

Just a day ago, BIGBANG member G-Dragon&rsquo;s agency YG Entertainment, denied the rumours running rife about his relationship with Shinsegae Group&rsquo;s chairwoman Lee Myung Hee&rsquo;s granddaughter  The two went out with other friends as she is known to be acquainted with quite a few artists associated with the agency and she shared a photo enjoying her time at the Mnet survival show &lsquo;Street Man Fighter&rsquo; concert in Seoul  Soon as rumours of them dating were doing the rounds, the retail giant released a rare statement rubbishing them and asking to refrain from making speculations 

Now, another set of rumours involving a K-pop artist and a K-drama star began their course on the internet and once again their agencies have come out to clarify the same  Here&rsquo;s a roundup of slightly questionable and some downright funny dating rumours in the world of K-pop currently 

NCT&rsquo;s Taeyong and actress Park Ju Hyun

On January 12, an online community post caught the attention of netizens which claimed that NCT member Taeyong and actress Park Ju Hyun were dating  The post included the two artists&rsquo; liking for online gaming and a reference to the SuperM member&rsquo;s username  They also shared information about the &lsquo;Love All Play&rsquo; actor attending a recent NCT concert 

The poster claimed that Taeyong&rsquo;s gaming ID was &lsquo;Sorang-i&rsquo;, and they related it to Park Ju Hyun&rsquo;s character named Sorang in her currently ongoing MBC K-drama &lsquo;The Forbidden Marriage&rsquo;  Furthermore, the post spoke about Park Ju Hyun attending NCT 127&rsquo;s concert and being seated in the section reserved for family members, feeding the rumours &nbsp;

Park Ju Hyun&rsquo;s agency, 935 Entertainment, has responded to this by saying that &ldquo;Actress Park Ju Hyun and NCT&rsquo;s Taeyong are just friends &rdquo; They clarified any confusion about her attending the concert by adding that she likes to attend shows of her favourite artists, and is known to posting photos from her visits  &ldquo;She personally attended IU&rsquo;s concert and shared a picture, and goes to various other concerts besides that [the NCT 127 concert], posting pictures from them &rdquo;

As for her online gaming, the source from her agency said that the actor enjoys games as a hobby, so much so that she has posted videos of her playing on her YouTube channel  They said that Park Ju Hyun and NCT&rsquo;s Taeyong are just buddies who like to play games together, and do not have anything further than that  The source added that the actress has a large group of friends who she keeps up with 

SM Entertainment, Taeyong&rsquo;s agency, reportedly gave a very brief response by calling the rumours false and reiterating that they are just friends 

SEVENTEEN&rsquo;s Vernon and a TXT staff member

Netizens claimed that SEVENTEEN member Vernon is dating a stylist from TOMORROW X TOGETHER&rsquo;s team  It was said that the staff member was recently asked if she was dating on her Instagram to which she replied with a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; over a photo of a teddy bear  Reportedly, a similar item was spotted being brought back by the SEVENTEEN member following the group&rsquo;s US tour  More similarities in their accessories which are being called as &ldquo;couple items&rdquo; were noted by netizens &nbsp;

There has been no response from SEVENTEEN&rsquo;s agency about the rumours and many are questioning the credibility of these claims &nbsp;

TXT&rsquo;s Yeonjun and LE SSERAFIM&rsquo;s Huh Yunjin

TOMORROW X TOGETHER&rsquo;s oldest member Yeonjun is known to be acquaintances with a lot of K-pop idols around the industry and often hangs out with them, building a big circle of friends  He also participates in dance challenges and one of his most loved ones are those with LE SSERAFIM&rsquo;s Kim Chaewon for the girl group&rsquo;s songs &lsquo;FEARLESS&rsquo; and &lsquo;ANTIFRAGILE&rsquo; 

Now rumours about him dating another LE SSERAFIM member are doing the rounds as netizens have reportedly found Huh Yunjin&rsquo;s Spotify account  The said account allegedly has the songs previously suggested by the K-pop idol and is named &lsquo;Yunny&rsquo; which goes around as Yunjin&rsquo;s nickname  The netizens are also claiming that Yunjin&rsquo;s sister&nbsp;reportedly follows the account 

The interesting bit comes in with the details that people have noticed as the made note of the profile photo which is reportedly a drawing of a girl and a boy, claimed to be Yeonjun and Yunjin  The picture in concern is drawing similarities to the LE SSERAFIM member&rsquo;s recent most solo release &lsquo;I&ne; DOLL&rsquo; which has an animated photo as its cover and the same animation throughout the music video  It is being said that the profile photo for the music account is of Yunjin sometime in September 2022 with the boy&rsquo;s drawing looking very similar to how Yeonjun looked at the same time  They have made connections to his greenish hairstyle and ear piercing  Another claim comes in the form of the idols&rsquo; appearance during the show &lsquo;The Game Caterers&rsquo; where the netizens spoke about them hanging around each other 

While the two are under the same parent label and could very well be friends, their respective agencies are yet to respond to the rumours

For the interaction with fans, Jungkook wore a black full-sleeved T-shirt and black pants as he sat on a chair outdoors near a bonfire. Reading a comment, he said, as translated by @BTStranslation_, "Why did I delete all the Instagram feed?" Jungkook laughed and said, "There's no reason for it. I just didn't like the vibes/setting of the feed so I thought of just redoing it. there was just something about it that I didn't like. I didn't even know there's a restoration time for it." When a fan asked why he changed his earrings to four, Jungkook said, "I didn't really change the earrings, they just fell out, it didn't hurt or anything." Speaking about V, he said, "Taehyungie is really handsome right? Yes! Among so many people I've seen, his looks are the most striking.. how can someone look like that.. he's really handsome, I agree." Jungkook did an impromptu dance of That That. Repeating the lines like PSY, he said, "Yoongi hyung's (brother) hip thrust really." During the live, Jungkook said, "The hair extensions.. from what I thought......I'm sorry. They were attached too early (in my opinion). I hope you guys will understand with a big heart." Speaking about growing his hair, Jungkook said, "Am I growing my hair long? I had that triangle kimbap phase, right? At that time I just kept growing it and people and staff kept telling me to groom it.. only if I had listened to them at the time, I could've grown it a bit prettier.. now I'm trimming and growing at the back." When a fan asked his location, he said, "Asking me where I am so that you can come where I am? it's so late right now, it's unsafe." He, however, revealed, "Yes this is the sound of rain! I'm outside! Yes, I'm camping! I can't tell you where I am!" Speaking about their ninth anniversary, he said, "Yes we're preparing really hard.. since we'll see you guys soon right?" He also said that he didn't exercise but drove on Tuesday. The singer also said, "It's a secret but.. I drank a glass of alcohol. I feel great." A fan asked, "Will you eat ramyeon (Korean snacks)?" and he responded, "Yes I will. I bought it for eating! (laughing) Sorry." He also said, "I'll do the live until 20 minutes.. never mind should I just do it until 30 mins? Since I like odd numbers.. wait do I like odd numbers or even numbers? I like odd numbers since there's an odd number in the middle." As he signed off, Jungkook said, "Have a good night, good day, good day. I'm always thinking of all of you. I might look soulless but I'm being sincere/it’s true. See you next time! It was good to see you too."

BTS’ RM has time and again shown his love for riding bicycles, so much so that he went ahead and released a song under the name of the vehicle on 6 June 2021 as a gift to his fans in celebration of BTS’ then-upcoming 8 year anniversary and the ongoing FESTA which is a yearly commemoration of the group’s debut June 3 is celebrated as World Bicycle Day and we think who better than the man and his song to celebrate it with ‘Bicycle’, is about to turn a year old soon and the song continues to be a slow pat on the head with its rhythmic beats and slow hums that are enough to lull you into a blissfully calm cluster of moments  The number presents itself as just that, a collection of the songwriter’s feelings as he maneuvers through the many turns of his life, characteristically placing his K-pop idol life under the microscope He talks about the moment of liberation on placing his two feet on the pedals, the one that also brings him despair over the many happenings of his life and longing for freedom as the pandemic came to be  The post-chorus is a string of “Na Na”, delivering the humming nature of his ride every time he drives around the town “슬프면 자전거를 타자” is how he begins the chorus, which translates to “If you are sad, let's ride a bicycle”  It signifies his go-to activity when he feels low is bicycle riding  He further adds to his unbinding moments by choosing to talk about the miracle that is now achievable, a midday dream come true RM and co-writer John Eun’s comparison of the bike ride to precious invisible things as one dances with the wind, looking like a bird, is relatable and takes you right back to a moment of unchained existence as the two wheels roll on a paved road Just as the singer wishes for the song to be a companion on the listener’s ride, we hope you can add it to your playlist after listening to it https://www youtube com/embed/6uq3P7zeYyUJoin the biggest community of K-Pop fans live on Pinkvilla Rooms to get one step closer to your favourite K-Celebs!

The K-pop recently joined Pharrell Williams for a conversation and gave a special advice to all K-pop trainees During the interaction, RM had a few things to say when Pharrell mentioned that boy groups in American don't seem to be much respected despite coming up with quality content. He first cautioned about being a part of the same industry before saying that there is always some good and some bad things He admitted to starting his career as a rapper but coincidentally being into the centre of this system. He lauded HYBE Labels and its founder Bang PD, saying that they understood the artists since they are themselves heavily involved in the artistry. He added that being reminded of being a human keeps them grounded through everything RM then went on to give a special advice to the trainees in the industry, "Please don’t forget you are human, you have a job in this industry and please be who you are and the fact that what we can do can influence the people, can charge each other’s batteries, you know, give, take love back and forth. That’s what I think has always been important for me." A few months ago, BTS had announced that they are going separate ways to pursue solo careers, however, they pledged to return someday. The South Korean boyband BTS was formed in 2010. They had also taken break in December 2021 after the group said that they needed some time to recharge Earlier this year, Jung Kook released a solo single titled My You, while J-Hope headlined Chicago's Lollapalooza festival in July. Jimin had said that they were going through a rough patch and they were trying to find their own identities, which will be an exhausting and long process

Only family members and close friends attend the ceremony

The track released on Friday on the webtoon's official YouTube channel. The track has been lauded by ARMY, the BTS fandom. BTS' Stay Alive was partially released on February 4, along with episode four of the webtoon.

As per a statement by Hybe, Stay Alive is a pop ballad that has an energy that complements the storyline that portrays confrontations between humans and the Beom tribe in a corrupt world.

Taking to the comments section of the song on YouTube, ARMY praised the track. A person wrote, "Jungkook's voice really is something else. He truly has no limits as a singer and Suga production is perfection in itself I really proud of them." "Jungkook's vocals heal the pain in the soul, this production and composition by Yoongi save lives, and this translation of Stay Alive embraces tight hearts through the hard days. Proud to be army," said a fan. "There are like 20 vocalists in Jungkook. He is so versatile as a singer!" commented a person. "True fact: Jungkook vocal is a joke. His vocals so soft and healing," said another fan. "This song feels like a warm hug. And Jungkooks voice is really something else...While listening to my heart was beating fast and for 2 minutes it felt like I was in a different world," wrote a person. "My eyes suddenly turned moist... It's so so so good... His vocals are no joke... Jungkook and Suga truly did their best in bringing out this masterpiece..." according to another fan.

BTS member Min Yoongi aka SUGA is one of the hottest producers in the Korean music industry. But he is also turning out to be the surprise BTS member who can drop thirst traps out of nowhere.

BTS SUGA aka Min Yoongi has posted some pics from a unknown photoshoot. We can see that he has donned the Victorian look with a coat and ruffled shirt. His hair seems to have a personality of its own. Fans are wondering from where are the pics ARMY just cannot get over the pics of Min Yoongi. They are wondering if he has done a magazine photoshoot or is he coming up with a new album that is shot with Victorian influences. Some days back, Kim Taehyung made our hearts aflutter with his looks as an English gentleman. This is what ARMY tweeted Kim Taehyung was like a dream as he dressed up like an English gentleman. But BTS rapper Min Yoongi aka SUGA looks no less than a Byronic hero in these clicks

BTS and Halsey's bond has always grabbed headlines in Hollywood News When asked about a new song together, Halsey said that she would like to collaborate with them again but added that it might not be like Halsey and BTS. It seems Halsey meant it could be a collaboration with one of the Bangtan members just like she worked with Suga on Suga's Interlude BTS are soon going to enlist in the military starting with Kim Seokjin aka Jin. The rest of the Bangtan Boys will enlist as per their schedules. The band will reconvene in 2025

Run BTS announced its first drop in the new year with a new version of the highly popular variety show that brings together one of the biggest acts of the planet in their most real and fun state  Titled &lsquo;Run BTS! 2023 Special Episode Next Top Genius&rsquo;, the teaser foreshadowed a group time with unlimited laughter incoming for the BTS ARMY 

Pizza time

Celebrity chef Paik Jong Won, who has previously worked with the South Korean group for another &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; episode, has become friends with the members, especially the oldest, Jin  In fact, the chef and the singer decided to have their own short variety show named &lsquo;Drunken Truth&rsquo; where they handmade some alcohol  Paik Jong Won sent some delicious pizzas from his brand to the BTS members who devoured them 

V and Jungkook&rsquo;s predicament

While the hyungs were enjoying the pizza, the two youngest tried not to give in to their cravings  Sat beside each other, the maknaes were controlling their urge to grab a bite from the many tasty-looking slices while the older members lightly teased them about it  It became a fight against their own decisions as the two members were on diet and stuck to not caving into the wants  Jungkook even went ahead and held a slice right against V&rsquo;s nose just to see if he would be tempted but the &lsquo;Sweet Night&rsquo; singer stuck to his resolve &nbsp;

Jin&rsquo;s &ldquo;controversial&rdquo; toppings remark

The &lsquo;The Astronaut&rsquo; hitmaker gobbled down the pizza and praised all the mouthwatering toppings as the other members agreed  However, there was one particular comment that made global fans do a double take  Jin raved about the pickles he was eating with his pizza and asked, &ldquo;How do people overseas eat pizza without pickles?&rdquo;  While many questioned his topping choices, others came to his defence saying that he meant radish pickles and not the cucumber ones trying to make the situation better, launching a hilarious discourse across social media about his pick 

The game of 16

BTS started light with a card game where they put their minds to test  Putting their matha and addition skills to test, SUGA was the first one out while the rest fought it out with numbers  Towards the end, as only members Jimin, Jin and RM stayed, the former&rsquo;s move made RM yell out &lsquo;Shibow&rsquo; (fifteen: shib means ten + ow meaning five) making everyone flustered as the pronunciation is too close to a Korean cuss word  They clarified the same amidst fits of laughter and disbelief  The first game&rsquo;s winner was Jimin, followed by the ranks in order: RM, Jin, J-Hope, V, Jungkook and SUGA, who came in last 

The &lsquo;Liar&rsquo; game

BTS played an upgraded version of the famed mafia game as they were divided into two teams in each round: the liar team and the citizens/villagers team  While they all tried their best to fool each other and find out who the actual liars are, it was only more apparent how well the BTS members knew each other and were accustomed to their presence  To add to the fun, each one of them was given electroencephalograph cat ears  As they lied or tried to be cheeky, the ears moved and made them look adorable  When a question about if they liked to take showers frequently or not was raised, they failed to lie and the liar team was found out easily  The next question was about them having fruity faces and though they faltered, it became a hilarious round of guessing who was which fruit  The last question was about dancing when sad and soon the fingers were pointed once again  In the end, the game came to a close with Jungkook being rightfully picked as the liar 

The following week&rsquo;s episode was teased next with more fun games at the expense of the BTS members who are always ready to unleash their funny sides  After the group events, it is time for solo games that will earn the members more points and hopefully, a reward awaits them at the end 
nYyAQ_w0qGcAbout Run BTS

The famed variety show was begun by the South Korean septet in 2015  It did not gain the numbers it currently boasts right off the bat as it first started slowly with smaller episodes that introduced the group member&rsquo;s traits to the world  Over time, their charms had the fans hoodwinked, and as the global influence, as well as their amount of fans, grew, so did the interest in their non-music activities, with the primary focus on &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo;  The show took a break of 10 months and returned late last year with special episodes released every few weeks to keep the momentum going

Firstly, it's time for BTS' youngest member Jungkook's birthday on September 1. Next, we have is BTS leader Kim Namjoon aka RM's birthday on 13 September. Lastly, Park Jimin aka Jimin celebrates his birthday on the 13th of October. And ARMYs across the globe are planning to celebrate the BTS members; birthday. Group and individual projects have been organised by the ARMYs everywhere. Let's have a look at a few of Desi BTS ARMY's birthday projects for RM, Jimin and Jungkook BTS ARMY in Delhi/ NCR has organised a collaring drive for the street dogs in Cannaught Place, Delhi. The drive is happening on 3rd September. The aim of this project is to put reflective collars around street dogs to avoid accidents of the strays. On the day of the drive, ARMYs would get to spend time with the street doggos, collar them and also feed them. The collar costs Rs 50 only. Jungkook and all the BTS members are quite fond of dogs. Jungkook has three fur buddies, Bam, Song and Paeng. Jungkook will be so happy. The birthdays of Bangtan Boys will be a huge trend in Hollywood News RM is known for his love for art, music and nature. And hence, to celebrate BTS leader, Kim Namjoon's birthday, the BTS ARMY in Delhi, India has organised a plantation drive. The aim of this drive is to plan about 300 trees. Previous, they had planet 180 trees and this year's goal is 300. The cost of one plant is Rs 100. ARMYs can also donate to this cause and there's no limit to the donation amount. Namjoon will be so proud Last but not least, we came across a very sweet gesture by the BTS ARMYs for the trio – RM, Jimin and Jungkook's birthdays. ARMYs have organised a fundraiser called Forget Me Not. It is for the elderly in India who have been affected by Alzheimer's. The donations will proceed to Hope Ek A.S.H.A foundation, an NGO that aims to build a dementia-friendly society and build an exclusive home for elderly patients suffering from Alzheimer's.

Is BTS really on a hiatus? Well, hiatus or not, there's no dearth of content featuring the Bangtan Boys – RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook. We would be getting some amazing solo content from BTS members soon RM aka Kim Namjoon is the leader of BTS, Bangtan Sonyeodan. He has been in charge of keeping together the other six members and maintaining harmony and leading the pack. And while doing so, Joonie aka RM turned from Rap Moster to RM (Real Me), father-figure types. From Namjoon comforting a crying Taehyung to being concerned about Jungkook and Jimin sleeping on the floor. From giving piggyback rides to J-Hope to helping the eldest child - Jin - whenever he is stuck. From collecting the members for a hug to cheering on the members being cute and adorable. And also being strict with the boys when they get out of hand, especially the maknae line - Park Jimin aka Jimin, Kim Taehyung aka V and Jeon Jungkook aka Jungkook. Despite RM not being the eldest member, he has turned into someone the Bangtan Boys rely on and look up to on various things. RM lets the boys be themselves and accepts all their shenanigans like a resigned father. Well, it is very funny and goofy. Who knew RM's dream of being a dad would come true in this way? Teehee, just kidding Meanwhile, RM is not new to solo projects. He has dropped two mixtapes of his own RM (2015) and Mono (2018) which were widely acclaimed. Mono had peaked at 26 on Billboard 200 which was the highest-charting album by a Korean soloist in chart history. BTS RM aka Kim Namjoon has collaborated with various artists such as Wale, Younha, Warren G, Gaeko, Krizz Kaliko, MFBTY, Fall Out Boy, Primary, and Lil Nas X to name a few. He has a KOMCA credit score of 199. He is gearing up for his solo album next and hopes that he is the one to release his solo project after J-Hope
ARMY took to Twitter to share pictures of the tattoo, that appears to be RM's tribute to his seven-member band. 7 was also the name of the band's 2020 album. The fans are convinced that other members of the K-pop group must have also gotten similar tattoos, as they had previously discussed on several occasions. V had spoken about it on Weverse, saying, “We’ve been talking about friendship tattoos forever. We’ll do it someday. Please look forward to it.” RM had also talked about it in a V Live, revealing that they have had discussions about getting a friendship tattoo. He had said, "Let’s tattoo seven dots or do seven of something. Or just simply tattoo the number seven. But if we’re actually doing it, I want to do it on the ankle. You know, it’s simple.” RM went with his last idea and tattooed the number seven on his ankle. ARMY flooded Twitter with comments about the tattoo. One wrote, "OMG they got the 7 tattoo," while another commented, "They finally did it." A third one wrote, "OMGGG the friendship tattoo. I am screaming, crying."

Supreme Boi) which is more powerful and full of energy. I wonder what sort of songs I can come up with ranging between these polar opposite songs. It’s fun and meaningful to come up with ideas for expanding my musical spectrum." "I think that always challenging myself with no limits in the musical spectrum is who I am and who BTS is.

Before cutting the cake, he urged everyone watching his live, including his crew, staff and fans, to sing the happy birthday song with him.

During season three of BTS' reality show Bon Voyage in 2018, group members travelled to Malta where they engaged in several activities. While walking around one evening, Jungkook came near a place where people were busking. As he looked around, a member of his crew asked if he wanted to sing too and he smiled expressing his wish. When Jin and J-Hope came to know about Jungkook, they ran to the area. As they rushed, Jin said, "He's different. The main vocalist of BTS is different." When they met Jungkook, J-Hope said, "We came here because we heard you're going to sing." As Jungkook sought suggestions, Jin and J-Hope bombarded him with songs such as Torri Kelly, Love You Hate You, Paper Heart, and La La Land. After much discussion, Jungkook said he would sing Adam Levine's Lost Stars. Walking up to the mic, Jungkook bowed and greeted the people, "Nice to meet you." He then spoke in Korean to Jin and J-Hope sitting nearby, "I drank a little." As J-Hope said, "You can do it. You will be fine. It's okay", he replied, "I don't care if I ruin it." Before starting the song he said his iconic line, "Let's get it" leaving Jin and J-Hope in splits. Watch video of Jungkook busking on Malta While Junkook sang, J-Hope recorded the video while the crowd listened to him. As he concluded the song and said, "Sorry, thank you", the crowd was heard hooting, screaming and clapping. When they made their way to the hotel, J-Hope told Jungkook, "All the people were singing along. Right, everyone next to us was singing along." Jungkook who was watching the recording on J-Hope's phone, returned it to him saying, "I'm too embarrassed to watch it. I was off-tune. I messed the song up. I was all over the place tune-wise. Next time I'll be fully prepared." Jin and J-Hope cheered him up saying, "It was very beautiful. I feel like I'm in love. No, you did well. You were in tune." In June, Jungkook collaborated with singer Charlie Puth on a new single Left and Right. BTS is currently on a break as a unit with the members pursuing solo projects. The group is awaiting their show titled Yet to Come in October where they will perform to support South Korea's bid to host the 2030 World Expo in Busan. As per their management agency BigHit Music, the show will be held at Busan Ilgwang special stage at 6 pm KST (9.30 pm IST) on October 15.

BTS and tales of their sasaeng fans are well-known. Now, one incident has been reported where a former sasaeng fan of the septet from Japan revealed how her obsession affected her life. It seems she was recruited by a Korean sasaeng who had told her to follow the band, and find out if Jungkook was dating someone or not. Koreaboo has revealed an incident which has been narrated on a YouTube channel Kisses Dahlia. A Japanese fan has said that she became a K-Pop fan in 2017, and BTS was her fave It seems she became famous because of the high quality pics that she took when she went to their concerts. This led to her being approached by a Korean sasaeng. She was given a 'job' to spy on the boys and take their pics. It seems she took up the offer because she needed the money. However, the sasaeng culture is very exhausting and found it worrying when she started enjoying the act of spying on the boys. The fan has said that her sister found out that she is a sasaeng and sent her for therapy. The girl has said that she is regretful of her actions and understands how sasaeng culture is harmful Even today Jimin said that some fans were calling him when he was doing his VLive with J-Hope after the Lollapalooza Festival. Fans wondered if they were sasaengs who were troubling the boys. We also remember how Jungkook kept getting calls in the middle of the night as he did a VLive chat during the Las Vegas tour. Sasaengs have been known to book tickets in same flights as the boys due to which they stopped taking commercial flights. Once, a sasaeng tried to kiss SUGA but was held by the bodyguard
A fan of Jazz music, V, aka Kim Taehyung, also teased that fans 'might be able to hear something jazzy' from him soon. He said that he liked jazz ever since he was a schoolboy, but it’s something that he 'only admired from afar and never dared to do myself'. He also said that he is 'intrigued' by whatever ARMY finds interesting. V added that as ARMY has been talking about wanting to hear him on the radio, so he wants 'to try some deejaying'. In an interview with Vogue Korea, V said, "There is a feeling of responsibility in whatever I do, but I don’t regret what I’ve done. I want to be a good person for those who love me. Our ARMY, BTS members, family and friends keep me happy and healthy even when I’m hurt and struggling. I cherish human connection. I am a people person and I truly enjoy working with everyone I cross professional paths with, including artists, directors, writers, and journalists like you. In the past, I used to be more reserved because I had been hurt by people who treated me simply as a valuable asset to know and not as a friend. But I still like people. It is thanks to the wonderful people in my life that I am who I am now." Speaking about the BTS members, V said, "We are a really positive group and all eager to unconditionally support each other. We had a meeting recently at Suga’s place to play the music we had been working on individually. We were dancing and praising each other non-stop. Being able to pursue one’s own music style lights the passion and enthusiasm in us. That’s what keeps us in love with what we do. I love seeing that." V will be seen next with the other BTS members at a concert in Busan in support of the city's bid to host the World Expo in 2030. The Yet To Come free concert will be held at 6 pm on October 15 at the Asiad Main Stadium. Earlier, it was scheduled to take place at Busan Ilgwang special stage in Gijang-gun.

Previously, episode 2 of SUGA&rsquo;s content &#39;Suchwita&#39; was posted on the YouTube channel &#39;Bangtan TV&#39;  Broadcaster Shin Dong Yeop joined as a guest  SUGA shyly greeted, &quot;I know you have filming every day  You are busy, but thank you so much for taking the time &quot; Shin Dong Yeop skillfully said, &ldquo;If SUGA calls, you should come &rdquo; The two then shared their sympathy through sincere talk 

Shin Dong Yeop, who celebrated his 31st year of debut this year  Suga said, &quot;Actually, I haven&#39;t had anyone who could be called a senior since my debut &quot; I still think about it  I wonder how you did for 31 years &rdquo; Then Shin Dong Yeop said, &quot;Since I was young, I have been loved and recognized, and I have earned money compared to my age  At one point, I took it for granted  I lost my gratitude and my original intentions  I can&#39;t even think of losing my original intentions &quot;&nbsp;

In addition, Shin Dong Yeop said, &quot;What I do best, even if I look at my strengths, I can work more happily without getting hurt  This is the broadcast I have been doing  Even if I work every day now, I don&#39;t feel stressed at all  I am so happy and happy when I work &quot; I&#39;ve never thought about the number of years, but since I realized that, I&#39;m really happy and mentally healthy &quot; On the other hand, SUGA sympathized, saying, &quot;We also thought about that a lot,&quot; and laughed, saying, &quot;Actually, the peak of singers&#39; peak wasn&#39;t long  We worked hard  But these days, we&#39;re working with gratitude in our hearts &quot; Suga also said, &quot;I don&#39;t think more people will listen to my music as time goes by  Being greedy for more than that is greed  Someone will listen to it  I think that&#39;s how it should go,&quot; he said honestly 

Suchwita Episode 1:&nbsp;

The first episode of SUGA&rsquo;s own talk show &#39;Suchwita&#39; was released on BTS&#39; official channel  &#39;Suchwita&#39; is a talk show where SUGA meets people from various fields through alcohol and music and shares honest stories  On this day, RM appeared as the first guest  The two had a deep talk with traditional liquor  SUGA tilted his glass, saying, &quot;Originally, RM wasn&#39;t the type to drink often  When I was young, when I came in after drinking, he was a very pitiful member  Lately, he&#39;s been drinking a little &quot; Recently, RM released his first official solo album &#39;Indigo&#39;  RM said, &quot;It feels a little strange  It&#39;s been exactly 15 years since I started music, and finally a work that can be officially recognized has come out  There were regrets or regrets about half of &#39;Mono &#39;, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case with this one  I&#39;m happy &quot;

While RM and SUGA looked back on the difficult pandemic period, they also foresaw the future activities of BTS  SUGA confessed that he remembers February 25, 2020, &quot;It was a shocking day for me  I saw my schedule canceled in front of my eyes in real time  With the pandemic coming, the tour was canceled, and I felt very helpless &quot; RM also looked back at the time of the tour cancellation and recalled, &quot;I didn&#39;t believe it then  It was a stage of denial  Later, I threw a pillow in reaction &quot;

BTS&rsquo; military enlistment:

BTS plans to enlist sequentially, starting with Jin, the eldest, to fulfill their military duty  Previously, the agency Big Hit Music said, &quot;We hope to resume activities as a complete group of BTS in about 2025, but it is difficult to specify the exact time at this point &quot; RM said, &quot;In 2025, it will be right after I&#39;m discharged &quot; &quot;If I return to society quickly, shouldn&#39;t the members do some work before returning or prepare something for me?&quot;

In response, SUGA said, &quot;One of the hardest things since I was young was being afraid of the future &quot; The point in time was 2020  So I can&#39;t say, &#39;I&#39;m going to do something in 2025&#39;&quot;, taking a cautious stance  RM said, &ldquo;It would be nice if we could all gather together and promote as a whole in 2025 as we wish &rdquo;

At the concert, RM said, "I know there's a lot of noise out there about the Grammys, but you know, why give a s*** about it? Hating is their freedom, and they have their right to hate, but if it was me, I'd rather just talk with my friends in some cafe and then forget about it. Rather than tweeting about it or some interview. I won't do that because I'm a grown up. But anyway, we didn't come to Vegas for the Grammys, we came to Vegas for the ARMYs!" He also said, "The records, the titles, the accomplishments, the trophies, they're really important, but that wasn't the first thing, the first reason why we started all these things. These two hours communion, energy, eye to eye, singing along, dancing together, this communication, this is everything. This is why we're doing this right? I hope you know it. I love you. Let the haters hate, let the lovers love. Peace!" J-Hope, as translated by Twitter user @jhopestudio, said, "There’s nothing holding us back, no one can stop us now." At the start of the BTS concert, the show was delayed due to technical difficulties. Speaking about it, V said, "We had trouble with the screen earlier and I was thinking 'ahh s***** (expletive in Korean)'.” While translating, the translator said, "We had trouble with the screen earlier and I was thinking 'oh shoot'."

In the first photo, J-Hope arranged several photos from the members' The Red Bullet Tour. Apart from the BTS members, the pictures also featured choreographer Son Sung-deuk and other crew members. With the photos, he wrote, "2014, 2015." The Red Bullet Tour, also known as BTS Live Trilogy Episode II: The Red Bullet (2014) and BTS Live Trilogy Episode II: The Red Bullet (2015), was BTS' first concert tour. The show was held to promote their 2 Cool 4 Skool (2013) debut single album, O!RUL8,2? (2013) EP, Skool Luv Affair (2014) EP, and Dark & Wild (2014) studio album.

As translated by Twitter user @BTStranslation_, the letter read, "To, Hoseokie hyung (elder brother). Ah hyung. Since this is the first time I'm writing a letter to a member, so it's a little awkward (laughs). I'm dying of the cheesiness (laughs). I couldn't celebrate hyung's birthday last year as I wanted so it kept bothering me. But this time I wanted anything at all out of (what I wanted) so I've tried preparing even if it's simple." "I'm always thankful and please guide (us) the members well in the future too. Hyung probably also has a lot of worries and tough things but thank you for always working even harder than the members without showing it. It'll be hard in future too so please really take care of your body well. These days (your/our) body aches often too but... Anyway, and happy birthday from the bottom of my heart. In future too, I might upset you (sometimes) so please look after me well-! (very cutely) Love you! (very cutely) - dongsaeng (younger sibling) Jiminie," it read.s In the next Instagram Story, J-Hope tagged BTS members RM and Suga. He held an Eminem concert ticket dated August 19, 2012, in his hand. In the last photo, J-Hope wore a smiley bucket hat and a mask covering his face as he looked down. The rapper wore a black T-shirt and stood inside a room. BTS members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook are awaiting the release of their upcoming anthology album Proof. It will release on June 10 and consist of old and new tracks.
Earlier Jimin had shared a post, saying, "I made the title for Yoongi hyung's (elder brother) V Live." The title for Suga's Live was, 'My hair has grown a lot longer'. When a fan teased Suga saying that he's getting younger, he laughed and said, "I'm 30, I'm not that old yet." Speaking about the original soundtrack, Stay Alive, that he produced for the webtoon 7 Fates Chakho, Suga asked the feedback of his viewers. As translated by Twitter user @BTStranslation_ Yoongi spoke about both the tracks--Stay Alive and Girl of My Dreams, revealing that he wrote the lyrics for the songs on the flight to the US. He also said he recorded Girl of My Dreams almost as soon as he landed there. Suga then spoke about the lyrics of Stay Alive and also about Jungkook who sang the song. "I wrote the lyrics for Stay Alive with keeping the webtoon in mind. Jungkook recorded the song so well. The chorus was so high but he didn't even do a re-recording, it was approved at once. He's a person overflowing with talent." When a fan asked if Suga was working on Stay Alive in In The Soop, he replied, "Yes right. But at the time Jungkook's melody was not put in the song. It's the one I was working on in In The Soop." Suga also promised ARMY that he will hold a live session on his birthday, which is on March 9. "It's my birthday soon, I'll see you guys on my birthday. I'll come live again on my birthday," he said. When asked what he planned to do on his special day, Suga replied, "What will I do on my birthday? The day after is concert day so I don't think I can do much (laughed)." BTS will hold three concerts in Seoul this month. The BTS Permission To Dance On Stage-Seoul is scheduled on March 10, 12 and 13. The BTS member also spoke about their home concert next week, "The concert is going to be very fun. We're preparing hard. We've been looking forward to a concert in Korea. It will still be quite chilly in March so I'm trying not to get sick." About their Las Vegas concert, Suga said, "I'm excited for the Vegas concert too, the renewed venue. The stadium itself looked so cool, we saw it while passing by." The dates of the concerts are April 8, 9, 15 and 16. When a fan teased him saying Bangtan (BTS) is so lucky they can go to Bangtan concert, Suga laughed and said, "Haha, they (we) go every time." A fan wrote, "If I can't go to the concert I'll die", Suga responded laughing, "It's not like that. You can watch it online too." When he asked ARMY to not get 'too nervous' during ticketing and be calm, a fan said, "Is there a way not to get nervous (about ticketing)?" He replied, "Just do it as you normally would. Like when you're choosing from a menu." The BTS members--RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook last December debuted on Instagram. Speaking about his feed, Suga said, "I don't know what pictures to upload on Instagram. I don't know how to make my feed look pretty, either. I normally don't take pictures. I'm still not sure what this 'Instagram vibe' is all about." Suga who recently recovered from Covid-19, said, "My condition is all better now. It's been like three months since I contracted it (Covid-19). People don't always catch it cause they didn't take care. No one wants to contract it on purpose. It's not your fault." Suga also replied when asked if his pet Holly still walks all over him, "Yes. When I get home he comes with his clothes held in his mouth like let's go on a walk. He's sleeping right next to me every day."

 'BTS members RM, Jin, V, and Jungkook featured in a new Bangtan Bomb video from last year when they performed at The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. The video was dropped on Bangtan TV\'s YouTube channel on Wednesday. It showed the members recording their dance performances to their tracks Butter and Dynamite for the show. Titled BTS’s Chaotic Break Time, the video started with Jungkook giving an update about the members. "We just finished Dynamite and Butter. We\'re recording it but the song (Butter) hasn\'t been released yet. It hasn\'t hit me yet. Until it\'s really released we\'ll keep preparing and practising whenever we have time." As Jungkook spoke, V stood behind him giving directions to Jin on what to say on camera. At first, Jin spoke about his appearance in the song, "It\'s not that I opened the performance fancy. I just stood up and walked. If that looked fancy all I could say is that my face was fancy." Jin then burst out laughing and said, "Our members are listening to this through the mic so it\'s a bit embarrassing." While talking, Jin kept on shifting his glances at the camera and V. He then showed a finger heart revealing that V asked him to do so. Speaking about V, Jin said, "He said to say something to the camera. He told me to say ‘Please look forward to it’." As V continued giving instructions on the mic set, Jin obediently repeated it in the camera, "He said he loves ARMY. He said he can\'t wait to hold a concert." Following this, RM became the next member to feature in the clip. As soon as he showed up, Jin and V joined him and they started interrupting each other\'s interviews. RM started with, "Hello. Welcome to the first day of our Butter promotion. I sincerely..." However, he was cut off by V saying, "You have nose hair." As RM moved away, V said in the camera, "Hello ARMY, I\'m Kin Taehyung." Here Jin said, "You have mouth hair." V walked away and Jin said, "Hello everyone. This is Jin." But V interrupted saying, "You have armpit hair." As he started talking facing the camera, RM came and said, "You have eye hair." Smiling at the camera, RM said, "It\'s s nice to meet you guys." As V walked into the frame asking RM, "You got neck hair?", Jin told the group leader, "You look handsome today." Finally, Jin was able to say, "Hello. I\'m Jin. What we\'re doing today is recording Butter. It\'s very awkward since no one\'s pushing their way in. Fighting!" Next on V\'s target was Jungkook. As the youngest member said, "We\'ll continue to show you good performances" V pushed him out of the frame saying, "Outta my way." As the video ended, V said, "Everyone, please look forward to it." Last year, BTS members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook had to participate in a skit for The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. Butter released in May last year and clinched the top spot of the Billboard Hot 100 for nine consecutive weeks. The song also broke several records including Most Viewers for the Premiere of a Music Video on YouTube, Most Viewers for the Premiere of a Video on YouTube, Most-viewed YouTube Music Video in 24 hours by a K-pop group and Most Viewed YouTube Music Video in 24 hours.',

He danced to BTS\' song Dynamite (Tropical Remix) with a complete new choreography. After the festival, J-Hope and Jimin posed for pictures together. The official Twitter handle of BTS shared a series of pictures from the event. Speaking to the audience at the festival, J-Hope said, "I pour my heart and soul into my music. Even if we speak different languages, I hope you listen to my story." BTS fandom ARMY took to Twitter and showered love on J-Hope for his performance. A fan wrote, "Goosebumps. Thank you J-Hope." "J-Hope owned it. I\'m just at home but I felt like I attended personally I\'m sweating, screaming," said another fan. "You have just witnessed the legendary artist Jung Hoseok make history. #HOBIPALOOZA," tweeted another fan. After his electrifying performance, J-Hope held a live session on V Live which was also joined by Jimin. Speaking to the fans, J-Hope said, "The process of this album that began from desire and childish ambitiousness, we\'re moving magnificently towards the finale of one of the processes. Through this album, all the schedules became my blood and flesh (part of me) and while looking at you all and our ARMY & the public while (performing in) Lollapalooza today, once again I think another determination and definite faith has formed." Speaking about Jimin, J-Hope said, "Since the moment he came, I\'ve had the smile flower bloomed on me. I was really into the process as you felt when you came here, it was a world of darkness, you came and became my light. You entered like \'J-Hope-the light\'." Jimin complimented J-Hope\'s performance and dedication. "He really has been working so hard.. like not eating at the time, even losing weight, working in the absolute dark— like even I like dark places but it was really too dark? Did you guys see the dynamite dance? I feel like we should change the main choreography." On his time on stage at the event, J-Hope said, "Honestly it was nine songs originally but it became 10. I think the run time went over one hour." Jimin replied, "We couldn\'t tell, it went by quickly" and J-Hope added, "Maybe cause I didn\'t say endments, it went by quickly." As the live ended, Jimin told ARMY that J-Hope \'didn\'t even sleep properly in anticipation and the rapper replied, "I couldn\'t sleep more than three hours." He signed off by saying, “Also feeling a little abashed to say this to myself but I want to tell myself that I\'m proud for overcoming this moment.”',
 'After the performance, BTS interacted with the drummer-rapper who said that their track Yet To Come reminds him of church and called it \'fantastic\'. Anderson also spoke a few words in Korean. He also revealed, "It was my son because he\'s a big fan, he made me a fan. I\'ve been obsessed, I\'ve been ARMY ever since." They also spoke about attending each other\'s concerts and complimented them. After the rapper left, the members spoke about their \'best moments so far\' in their careers. J-Hope said that it was the day BTS was born, June 13, 2013, while Jimin recalled it as the day when BTS had their solo concert in 2014. Suga said for him, it was BTS\' showcase day on June 12, 2013, "I still remember the basement floor at the King Kong building, Ilchi Art Hall." RM said that when BTS had their first concert at the Olympic Gymnastic Arena, it was his \'best moment\'. V said, "For me, it was those days when Jungkook would cry if I asked, \'Are you crying?\' That was the best moment for me." The other members teased him. Jungkook recalled that the day he joined BTS was his \'best moment\'. "I believe BTS wouldn\'t exist without me. I\'m sorry that was a joke," he said. Jin credited all the moments so far as his \'best moment\'. BTS members next spoke about their journey since Covid-19 in 2020 during which \'a lot of things changed\' for them and the ARMY. RM said, "Most of the things we\'ve done since 2020 weren\'t planned in advance. None of it was planned." Suga added, "Nothing went as planned." RM continued, "As we went on we were sometimes a little afraid and unsure if we were on the right path. We\'ve also had growing reservations about what was the right answer." Jimin said, "We thought the pandemic would be over soon...but none of us thought that it would take more than two years." Suga said, "We\'re like \'Let\'s give it three months. We\'ll be able to have a concert in three months\'." Jungkook added that it was then the group came out with their song Dynamite as it was their \'way of braving the Covid-19 pandemic\'. They also spoke about their album BE, songs Butter and Permission to Dance and their concerts. Speaking about Proof, V said, "If you look closely many of our unreleased songs are included in this album. We took those songs as a chance to reminisce on when they were recorded. We also wanted to wrap up our first chapter, that\'s why we created our album." Suga added, "When I grow interested in an artist, it\'s hard to listen to all their albums. This album is like the essence. Once you follow this guide, you\'ll get a rough idea of who BTS is. It\'s like a textbook or a guidebook you can show to beginners." Last week BTS released Proof via BigHit Music. The album, comprising three discs, is a look back on the group\'s journey in the last near decade. The songs in the album comprise the members\' personal selections from their old tracks. It is a gift to ARMY and also features a brand-new single Yet to Come (The Most Beautiful Moment), Run BTS, and For Youth.',
 'During the episode, the members took a trip down memory lane as they visited their dorms, spoke about eating icecreams, visiting a particular restaurant and taking walks near their dorm. They also recalled the famous dumpling incident (involving a heated argument between Jimin and V) and the banana incident (when Jungkook noticed fruits disappearing from the fruit basket ARMY gave him. At that time, Jungkook argued saying it was his and J-Hope got angry, threw a banana at him and said, \'You eat it all\'). While taking a walk near their dorm, RM recalled how the members walked on the street every day during the initial days of their career. He also said how he and V got caught while having ice cream. Recalling the exact spot, RM said, “I got caught exactly around here. I took the ice cream cone and stuffed it in my pocket. He (the person) asked where we were going, so we just said, \'Back to our dorm\'. In the end, the ice cream melted in my pocket, but I didn\'t want to waste it. So I took it off and ate it again.” While RM and Jimin took a walk, Jin and V feasted on Jajangmyeon (Korean noodle dish). Suga sat in his car outside the restaurant that the members frequented earlier. The members tried to figure out each other\'s locations as they travelled in their cars around the city. By round two, Jungkook joined RM, Jin, Jimin, and V. Suga also met J-Hope near their old dorm and screamed \'my friend\' from his car. All the members met at the Jamwon Han River Park and hugged each other. For a few moments, they forgot about filming and huddled together asking each other where they first went. The crew had to interrupt asking them to face the camera. In the last round, the members were given the keyword, ARMY. Though they were together, they could not discuss which place they would go to separately. RM kept hinting to J-Hope, "We can go back to a place we\'ve been already." He suggested the Olympic Stadium. All the members were seen heading to the venue except V who chose the first showcase venue of BTS. He said, "I\'ll ask ARMY if it should be the first concert or first showcase." However, he got shy and couldn\'t ask anyone despite making several attempts in Garosu-gil. The video ended with all of them meeting for lunch during which the members discussed on what to do next. RM suggested \'getting middle-aged men from just around neighbourhood and playing 7-7 volleyball\'. Jungkook suggested they learn Sepak takraw, a game, Jin asked about farming, and Suga came up with the idea of racing. Jimin said, " I want to try pole dancing too." RM added, "That suits you though." The video ended with V goofily saying, "Run BTS will continue running."',
 'BTS, who are preparing to release a new album next month, is planning to skip the Billboard Music Awards this year due to their packed schedule  This comes despite the fact that the K-pop group made history by securing the highest number of nominations by a K-pop group at the award show  ARMY might not be able to watch a performance by the band at BBMA, but they are still low-key happy about it  Also Read| BTS reveals title and cover of Proof\'s lead single; ARMY solves mystery from seven years ago: \'HYYH era is back\'BTS members RM, Suga, V, Jin, Jimin, J-Hope, and Jungkook were in Las Vegas last month for their four-day Permission to Dance on Stage concert  However, they have decided not to return to the city this month for the BBMA on May 15 As per Allkpop, this is because the band is currently focusing on their new album Proof, due to come out on June 10  They will not be attending any award show until then and will give their acceptance speech with a video if they win The K-pop group fans, collectively known as ARMY, supported their decision and also said that they are even happy about it  In BTS\' last Billboard interview, the ARMY was indirectly accused of manipulating the charts in their favour by mass-buying their songs  This came after their English song Butter, released in May 2021, became the longest-ranking no 1 song on Billboard Hot 100 chart after topping it for 10 weeks In response, RM had defended the ARMY and suggested that it\'s up to Billboard to change the rules and base the ranking on streaming  Billboard later changed the rules of their digital sales, making it harder for fans to purchase their favourite artists\' music and support them, further angering the ARMY BTS fans are still fuming at Billboard for it  One wrote on Twitter, "Honestly I’m so glad to hear that they decided to not attend this year  Their comeback is far more important than the BBMAs anyways," while another commented, "I\'m low-key happy that they are not attending BB will not get that clout it was wishing for but my second persona is thinking abt the performance we would have got " A third one wrote, "I support their decision  Literally after what BB keep doing they don\'t deserve BTS at all "In 2017, BTS became the first K-pop group to be nominated for and win a Billboard Award, and have won an award every year since then  This year, the band has been nominated seven times in six categories for their songs Butter and Permission To Dance at the Billboard Music Awards 2022 They have been nominated in the categories Top Duo/Group, Top Song Sales Artist, Top Billboard Global (Excl  U S ) Artist, Top Selling Song (in which they were nominated twice), Top Billboard Global (Excl  U S ) Song and Top Rock Song (which they share with Coldplay for “My Universe”)  This marks the highest number of nominations that any group or duo has received in any year',
 "BTS ARMY, Run BTS is finally back and the Tuesdays won't ever be so dull as they had been in the past 10 months. The newest episode of Run BTS dropped on Weverse, VLIVE and YouTube dropped a couple of hours ago. Run BTS is officially back! Since we still have to wait for another Tuesday for the continuation episode of Run BTS, we thought of bringing back some of the funniest and most entertaining episodes for y'all to binge-watch in your free time, meanwhile In this Run BTS episodes, BTS members – RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook pick their Manito and then play the game of jumping into the photo zone and axing expressions based on the given keywords. In the second episode of BTS X Manito, they play the game of Bingo based on food items on their bingo chart. The members have to act out the food items and the others have to guess the answer and tick off the list. These two are by far the most hilarious episodes of Run BTS In this episode of Run BTS, we saw the epic whisper challenge game where Jin aka Kim Seokjin showcased his amazing telepathic abilities and Jimin introduced us to La Chi Mo La La Not that the VR game part 1 is not that fun but the Part 2 of VR games played by the Bangtan Boys was more fun. J-Hope was the funniest especially when she dropped from the high rise. Taetae's swag to Jungkook being the pro at playing games was a sight for ARMYs BTS ARMY, if you want to have a good laugh while watching Run BTS episodes these two are great for laughter packs. It was in the second episode of Summer Outing that the boys had to fight with Jungkook and he still won the game. Jungkook is quite agile The Bangtan Boys - RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, Taehyung and Jungkook played some fun games whilst in Pajamas. The most fun part was chimchim aka Park Jimin's sketches on socks to guess the word by drawing. Guess who was the artist of the episode at that time? In this episode, the Bangtan Boys played games that they played in the past. Taehyung's memory power left the members speechless. The Rapline and the vocal line had been divided into two groups and the Rap line was at their hilarious best. The second episode also saw the return of the photo booth In these two episodes of Run BTS, we saw the Bangtan Boys getting missions. Hidden between them was a spy. The missions were to click photos with the rest of the members based on certain themes. However, when the soy was revealed, the Bangtan Boys felt the shock of their lives The 77-minute Debate episodes are the funniest of the lot.

 'BTS consists of members Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook&mdash;co-writes and co-produces much of their own material. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to incorporate a wide range of genres; their lyrics have often discussed mental health, the troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards self-love, and individualism. Their work also frequently references literature, philosophy and psychological concepts, and includes an alternate universe storyline.\n\nBTS in the beginning:&nbsp;\n\nAfter launching in 2013 with their single album 2 Cool 4 Skool, BTS respectively released their first Korean-language studio album, Dark &amp; Wild, and Japanese-language studio album, Wake Up, in 2014.

In 2020, BTS became the first all-South Korean act to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard Global 200 with their Grammy-nominated single Dynamite.

 'BTS members Jimin and V featured in a new Bangtan Bomb video. The clip, which was released on Tuesday on Bangtan TV\'s YouTube channel, showed them recall how they interacted with fans on camera after they debuted with RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope and Jungkook in 2013. The video started with BTS\' Jimin and V warming up using a chair before shooting for their track Butter last year. As Jimin lifted the chair over his head, V told him, "You\'ve to straighten your arms." He replied, "I can\'t go any higher because of the jacket. Here\'s the limit (as he showed how far he can lift the chair above him)." As their staff worked around them, they continued their exercise smiling. Next, Jimin came to the camera as he covered nearly the entire lens. He said, "Now we only have one last shooting left." V peered over his shoulder and asked what he was doing and if he was having fun. Jimin responded by laughing, "It\'s what we used to do when we debuted. We used to do this a lot when we debuted. We\'d get greedy and want to show more for our fans." Jimin then added, "We are talking now." Pointing at V, he said, "He used to do this a lot." V added, "It\'s true that I used to say things like that." The video ended with Jimin and V talking in \'sim\' language, as the caption read, all the while laughing and pulling each other\'s legs. All the BTS members, who are on an \'extended period of rest\', are gearing up for their upcoming concerts in Seoul next month. This will be BTS\' first show for th live audience in Seoul since the coronavirus pandemic began. The concerts, Permission to Dance on Stage-Seoul, will take place at Seoul\'s Olympic Stadium on March 10, 12 and 13, and will also be live-streamed, the group\'s agency Bit Hit Music had said. Their last concert for South Korean fans was in October 2019, a couple of months before the coronavirus began. As the pandemic spread in 2020, the band postponed and then called off their international tour involving nearly 40 concerts. They held some online shows instead. BTS debuted in 2013 and have produced many songs over the years. In November last year, they created history by becoming the first Asian artists to win the top prize at the American Music Awards. They played their first in-person concerts since the onset of the pandemic in November, in Los Angles. The pandemic also affected a few members--RM, Jin, Suga, Jimin and V, as they contracted the coronavirus. However, all of them have fully recovered.',
 'Recently, Jungkook along with the other group members RM, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, and V held a live session on V Live. However, Jin wasn\'t present with them as he underwent surgery for his finger injury. During the live, a fan asked, "What happened to Jungkook’s shirt during Fake Love?" At this, Suga asked if the button really popped off and Jungkook replied, as translated by Twitter user @btsbaragi_jk, "It got unbuttoned." The other members started teasing him. Suga asked, "You didn’t do that on purpose?" Jimin said, "You seemed to be continuously laughing and smiling as you performed." RM said, "I saw him before we went in (on stage) and he was pulling it off (at the thread) a lot." Jungkook said, "The reason I laughed is because I buttoned it up once but it got undone again so I was dumbfounded." Suga reminded RM that previously he had once accidentally ripped off Jungkook\'s buttons. To this Jungkook, added, "I did give it a thought. Since its already unbuttoned, should I unbutton another one? Should I just completely unbutton it?’" V chimed in saying, "I think it would be nice if you performed by taking it off one day." Jungkook replied, "No, not for me. I’m not ready yet." Jimin added, "As far as I know, at the time, the fans couldn’t hold back their cheers and a sound came out of their mouths." He was speaking of the time during the concert when Jungkook\'s blazer got unbuttoned. Suga asked Jungkook, "I heard you went in after putting in on oil on day three." While RM and J-Hope laughed, Jungkook said, "But I always do that since I have to show my abs. Always have to be prepared." Speaking about Jin, Suga said that he is taking rest and Jimin added that he is recovering well. RM said, "Don\'t worry too much, you guys, he said he\'s okay. The surgery was short and he\'s okay honestly." The live saw Jin\'s representative, BT21 character RJ\'s soft toy. Referring to it, Jungkook said, "That\'s why this friend came (RJ). Jimin said, "Jin hyung (brother) told us to convey his greeting to you guys. We saw him today" and RM added, "On seeing him, he was doing fine." Next, their conversation steered towards their Instagram accounts. Suga asked J-Hope if he has deleted all his Instagram photos. J-Hope replied, "No. I moved a couple over to archive. I didn\'t delete it. I moved them to the archive. Turns out you can bring them back later. I searched about it." Jimin also spoke on why he doesn\'t share posts on Instagram regularly. He said, "With Instagram, I can’t go on it because I’m scared I might press something wrong." As RM urged him to share posts he said he will. The members concluded the session by saying that they will hold another live in Las Vegas. BTS will perform in Las Vegas\' Allegiant Stadium on April 8, April 9, April 15, and April 16.',
 'Jay Park took to his Instagram account on Tuesday to share pictures from his recent meeting with Jungkook, and showered the K-pop star with praises. The first picture was a selfie in which Jungkook pouted as he kept his arm around Jay Park, who flashed a huge smile. In the second picture, both of them posed against a music workstation. Sharing the pictures, Jay wrote, “Even though he’s at the top, he has a growth mindset and he’s humble. What a stud… Plus he’s good at boxing… After I met Jk I can definitely see why they get so much love. Humble, [ambitious] and talented." Jungkook shared the post on his Instagram Stories. The post soon received several comments from fans asking if Jungkook is planning to collaborate with the American rapper, who was previously a part of K-pop group 2PM. Many fans commented "OMG," with one writing, "Are they making music together?? Collab?" Another commented, "Right now I will start praying that they make a song together, out of Jungkook\'s comfort zone, something Jay Park style." However, a large section of ARMY was not happy about the meeting and took to Twitter to say that they cannot forgive Jay Park. The Seattle-based rapper had risen to fame as the leader of the South Korean boy band 2PM in 2008. But he left the band and South Korea and returned home the next year following a major controversy when the comments he wrote about Korea in 2005 as a teenager were publicised by the Korean media. In addition, he had also previously criticised BTS in several tweets. He wrote in one such tweet in 2018, “Two ppl on the plane asked me if I was part of BTS … lol I need to get my weight up." ARMY cited these tweets as they suggested that Jungkook is posing with him because he is being held hostage. "Free Jungkook of Jay Park," one wrote, while another commented, "Free Jungkook. he only did what he had to do he didn’t mean it #jkheldhostage #jkhostagesituation." A third one wrote, "Jungkook prolly the nicest person on earth i know damn well that mf had a gun on the other side forcing him to take a selfie ! praying jungkook got home safely without finding out he lost his wallet #freejungkook." Another commented, "Jay Park the biggest hypocrite ever because he acted like he didn\'t shade BTS and ARMYS in the past but now he\'s all smiling and acting like a saint." Meanwhile, BTS members Jungkook, Jin, Jimin, J-Hope, Suga, and V have returned to South Korea after their Permission to Dance concert in Las Vegas. Group leader RM was not spotted with them during their arrival at Seoul airport on Tuesday.',
 'The video started with Jimin sitting in his car on his way to the shop. He said, "I\'ve always wanted to go to a workshop and make jewellery. I\'ve always wanted to try it. You all know that I like jewellery. So I thought I could go and make some simple bracelets for today. So that\'s where I\'m going right now." He also said, "I got my wisdom tooth pulled out. After I got my wisdom tooth out I ate more and gained weight. I\'m about 64.7 kg right now. I\'m gonna make jewellery and go on a diet." At the workshop, Jimin worked on making the jewellery. However, he broke the blade of the saw, he was working with, twice. He said, "I\'m so sorry. I just broke the last one and broke it again. I\'m very sorry." After getting the second replacement of the blade Jimin said, "Please last this time." After sawing, Jimin filed the metal and continued with the process to make the bracelet. As he hammered a metal piece, he asked the people, "Don\'t I look like an employee here? Are you here to pick up a project? What if I become your best apprentice?" Jimin continued working on the jewellery and said, "It feels so exciting. This is fun. So much effort goes into this." Jimin, after finishing making the bracelets, said, "I\'ll wear one on each wrist. It went faster than I expected." Wearing them he showed it to the camera and said, "These are the nice bracelets I made. I\'m so satisfied and had so much fun. The hammering was especially fun for me. The shaping process was fun. The sawing part was the hardest. It was so fun. If ARMY wants to try this kind of hobby too or if you want to make something valuable for yourself in a quiet place, it\'ll be fun to go to a workshop like this." Bangtan TV has been sharing videos featuring the vlogs of BTS members every week. So far V shared his vlog where he had meals with his crew, played golf and travelled around the city. In J-Hope\'s vlog, he gave a glimpse of the shooting of his latest album, Jack in the Box. The vlogs of RM, Jin, Suga, and Jungkook are yet to be released.',

I haven\'t been able to decide where to get it so I\'m trying to decide quickly. Will you guys help me decide? I\'ll go get it done with Jungkook once I choose where I\'ll get it done." When a fan suggested that he should get the tattoo under the left toe, V said, "I also thought about it." Recently, RM revealed that he got the tattoo inked on his leg while eagle-eyed fans discovered that Jimin got it on his finger. V spoke about Jungkook\'s new song My You, released ahead of BTS\' ninth anniversary, and said, "Jungkook\'s song? I heard Jungkook\'s song about a month ago... it\'s good, isn\'t it? Shall we listen to his song once? He made this song well!!" He also sang My You and later Jimin\'s OST debut song, With You, from Our Blues. He also said, "Our Blues…to be honest, from the 13th, 14th episode I’ve been crying at the end of every episode. It’s a show that I don’t think will come out again?" After asking fans, "you want me to turn on Run BTS?" he started singing the song as well. V also took up the \'Bangtan Don’t Laugh for 22 minutes\' challenge video as tweeted by @modooborahae. He said, “Everyone come in and if you’re ready, say \'Yes\' on Weverse. Oh, are you ready? Go to \'try not to laugh BTS version for 20 minutes\'. Which pic/clip did you say was fun? The Hangul Day special? Episode 86? But this is legendary? I definitely won’t smile. Okay, let’s go. What kind of expression can we have? We just can’t show our teeth. The vibe is already funny. Isn’t my hair more of a \'try not to laugh challenge\'?” The BTS member also spoke about actor Gang Dong-Won and watching the screening of Broker. "Oh, I saw the VIP screening well. I really liked how he came to my Las Vegas concert and I was thankful so I went to his. He’s my role model. I do have a lot of role models. But he’s from my hometown. He’s so handsome." BTS\' V started the live an hour before Proof Live and as fans asked him to watch it with them, he said, "I don\'t think that\'s possible. I got off work... but I also need to go home right?" However, he later said, "Alright, let\'s all watch together. I\'m going to watch this but since there are people who only have a phone... please go to (the Proof live) quickly." Earlier he had said, "Now all the music shows pre-recordings have finished.. since we have the Proof live at 9 PM, I thought I\'ll come on live until then.. since a lot of ARMYs came today but a lot couldn\'t come so you might be sad, I thought I\'d come live for you guys."

 'This year included several firsts for BTS, making them big moments for the group. As the year comes to an end, we take you on a brief journey on the major achievements and big moments of BTS this year. The year started with several BTS members facing health issues when they contracted Covid-19. Jin and Jimin even underwent finger and appendix surgeries, respectively, ahead of their concert in Seoul, their first on the home ground after over two years. Here\'s a recap of the big moments of BTS in 2022-- 1) Concerts in Seoul, Las Vegas, Busan: BTS’ Permission to Dance On Stage--Seoul concert was held in March. It was significant as it was the first time BTS had a concert with an in-person audience in the city in two and a half years. BTS next held their Permission to Dance On Stage concert in Las Vegas in April. The first concert came just days ahead of their performance at the Grammys. BTS also held its first free concert in Busan in October. For this show, BTS appeared \'without any additional fee\' and HYBE invested their personal funds for the concert. 2) BTS members at Grammy\'s: The seven members performed at the 64th Grammy Awards in April, their first in-person performance for which they received a standing ovation. Just ahead of the show, BTS members contracted Covid-19 and Jin could partially perform due to his surgery. The performance saw the members pulling off a museum heist on their single Butter. 3) BTS \'on a break\': Fans were left shocked and heartbroken when during the Festa dinner the group announced a \'hiatus\'. Suga had said in a video during the dinner as per the English subtitles, “So we’ve entered an off-season. We’re going into a hiatus now.” He later added, “It’s not like we’re disbanding. We should live doing what we want to do...Writing lyrics is the hardest. What message do we want to give? Nothing comes out anymore." Later, AP quoted BigHit\'s clarification, “BTS are not taking a hiatus. Members will be focusing more on solo projects at this time." RM and Jungkook also issued clarifications that they will not go on a hiatus. 4) BTS album Proof: The group released their anthology album Proof in June. The album is a 3-CD collection of BTS’ hit old as well as new songs. Proof included three new songs--Yet to Come, Run BTS, and Born Singer. Their old hits I Need You, Run, Fire, Fake Love, Persona, Moon, are also part of the album. It released a few days before their ninth debut anniversary, on June 10. 5) BTS at the White House: The group attended the White House Press briefing in May to discuss anti-Asian hate crimes. They made history as they had a private meeting with US President Joe Biden at the White House for the first time ever. They were invited to the White House in celebration of Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders Heritage Month (AANHPI Heritage Month). The US President surprised the members by playing Butter in the Oval Office before their discussion to make them \'feel at home\'. 6) BTS military enlistment: South Korea has a rule of mandatory military service for able-bodied men by 28. K-pop stars are granted the ability to defer their enrolment until 30. BTS ARMY has always dreaded the time when the members will have to spend months in the military. This year, in October, BigHit Music announced that military enlistment will begin with the eldest member Jin. All the other members--RM, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V aka Kim Taehyung and Jungkook will follow him. The group will reconvene in 2025. Though fans wished them well, the news left them emotional. Apart from these, BTS also made a comeback with their variety show, RUN BTS, after 10 months. Fans saw the members doing solo projects with Jimin singing With You for K-drama Our Blues, Suga produced and featured in That That with PSY, Suga and Jungkook came out with Stay Alive, and Jungkook treated fans to My You. The collaborations continued with Jungkook and Charlie Puth\'s Left and Right, J-Hope and Crush\'s Rush Hour, and Jin and Coldplay\'s Astronaut. While J-Hope released his first album Jack in the Box and performed at the Lollapalooza, RM too unveiled his first album Indigo.

appearance during the show &lsquo;The Game Caterers&rsquo; where the netizens spoke about them hanging around each other \n\nWhile the two are under the same parent label and could very well be friends, their respective agencies are yet to respond to the rumours \n\nStay updated with the latest Hallyu news on: Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat\nALSO READ: OMEGA X wins case against Spire Entertainment: Exclusive contracts suspended;

Reading a comment, he said, as translated by @BTStranslation_, "Why did I delete all the Instagram feed?" Jungkook laughed and said, "There\'s no reason for it. I just didn\'t like the vibes/setting of the feed so I thought of just redoing it. there was just something about it that I didn\'t like. I didn\'t even know there\'s a restoration time for it." When a fan asked why he changed his earrings to four, Jungkook said, "I didn\'t really change the earrings, they just fell out, it didn\'t hurt or anything." Speaking about V, he said, "Taehyungie is really handsome right? Yes! Among so many people I\'ve seen, his looks are the most striking.. how can someone look like that.. he\'s really handsome, I agree." Jungkook did an impromptu dance of That That. Repeating the lines like PSY, he said, "Yoongi hyung\'s (brother) hip thrust really." During the live, Jungkook said, "The hair extensions.. from what I thought......I\'m sorry. They were attached too early (in my opinion). I hope you guys will understand with a big heart." Speaking about growing his hair, Jungkook said, "Am I growing my hair long? I had that triangle kimbap phase, right? At that time I just kept growing it and people and staff kept telling me to groom it.. only if I had listened to them at the time, I could\'ve grown it a bit prettier.. now I\'m trimming and growing at the back." When a fan asked his location, he said, "Asking me where I am so that you can come where I am? it\'s so late right now, it\'s unsafe." He, however, revealed, "Yes this is the sound of rain! I\'m outside! Yes, I\'m camping! I can\'t tell you where I am!" Speaking about their ninth anniversary, he said, "Yes we\'re preparing really hard.. since we\'ll see you guys soon right?" He also said that he didn\'t exercise but drove on Tuesday. The singer also said, "It\'s a secret but.. I drank a glass of alcohol. I feel great." A fan asked, "Will you eat ramyeon (Korean snacks)?" and he responded, "Yes I will. I bought it for eating! (laughing) Sorry." He also said, "I\'ll do the live until 20 minutes.. never mind should I just do it until 30 mins? Since I like odd numbers.. wait do I like odd numbers or even numbers? I like odd numbers since there\'s an odd number in the middle." As he signed off, Jungkook said, "Have a good night, good day, good day. I\'m always thinking of all of you. I might look soulless but I\'m being sincere/it’s true. See you next time! It was good to see you too."',

 "BTS’ RM has time and again shown his love for riding bicycles, so much so that he went ahead and released a song under the name of the vehicle on 6 June 2021 as a gift to his fans in celebration of BTS’ then-upcoming 8 year anniversary and the ongoing FESTA which is a yearly commemoration of the group’s debut June 3 is celebrated as World Bicycle Day and we think who better than the man and his song to celebrate it with ‘Bicycle’, is about to turn a year old soon and the song continues to be a slow pat on the head with its rhythmic beats and slow hums that are enough to lull you into a blissfully calm cluster of moments  The number presents itself as just that, a collection of the songwriter’s feelings as he maneuvers through the many turns of his life, characteristically placing his K-pop idol life under the microscope He talks about the moment of liberation on placing his two feet on the pedals, the one that also brings him despair over the many happenings of his life and longing for freedom as the pandemic came to be  The post-chorus is a string of “Na Na”, delivering the humming nature of his ride every time he drives around the town “슬프면 자전거를 타자” is how he begins the chorus, which translates to “If you are sad, let's ride a bicycle”  It signifies his go-to activity when he feels low is bicycle riding  He further adds to his unbinding moments by choosing to talk about the miracle that is now achievable, a midday dream come true RM and co-writer John Eun’s comparison of the bike ride to precious invisible things as one dances with the wind, looking like a bird, is relatable and takes you right back to a moment of unchained existence as the two wheels roll on a paved road Just as the singer wishes for the song to be a companion on the listener’s ride, we hope you can add it to your playlist after listening to it https://www youtube com/embed/6uq3P7zeYyUJoin the biggest community of K-Pop fans live on Pinkvilla Rooms to get one step closer to your favourite K-Celebs!

 'Run BTS announced its first drop in the new year with a new version of the highly popular variety show that brings together one of the biggest acts of the planet in their most real and fun state  Titled &lsquo;Run BTS! 2023 Special Episode Next Top Genius&rsquo;, the teaser foreshadowed a group time with unlimited laughter incoming for the BTS ARMY \n\nPizza time\n\nCelebrity chef Paik Jong Won, who has previously worked with the South Korean group for another &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo; episode, has become friends with the members, especially the oldest, Jin  In fact, the chef and the singer decided to have their own short variety show named &lsquo;Drunken Truth&rsquo; where they handmade some alcohol  Paik Jong Won sent some delicious pizzas from his brand to the BTS members who devoured them \n\nV and Jungkook&rsquo;s predicament\n\nWhile the hyungs were enjoying the pizza, the two youngest tried not to give in to their cravings  Sat beside each other, the maknaes were controlling their urge to grab a bite from the many tasty-looking slices while the older members lightly teased them about it  It became a fight against their own decisions as the two members were on diet and stuck to not caving into the wants  Jungkook even went ahead and held a slice right against V&rsquo;s nose just to see if he would be tempted but the &lsquo;Sweet Night&rsquo; singer stuck to his resolve &nbsp;\n\nJin&rsquo;s &ldquo;controversial&rdquo; toppings remark\n\nThe &lsquo;The Astronaut&rsquo; hitmaker gobbled down the pizza and praised all the mouthwatering toppings as the other members agreed  However, there was one particular comment that made global fans do a double take  Jin raved about the pickles he was eating with his pizza and asked, &ldquo;How do people overseas eat pizza without pickles?&rdquo;  While many questioned his topping choices, others came to his defence saying that he meant radish pickles and not the cucumber ones trying to make the situation better, launching a hilarious discourse across social media about his pick \n\nThe game of 16\n\nBTS started light with a card game where they put their minds to test  Putting their matha and addition skills to test, SUGA was the first one out while the rest fought it out with numbers  Towards the end, as only members Jimin, Jin and RM stayed, the former&rsquo;s move made RM yell out &lsquo;Shibow&rsquo; (fifteen: shib means ten + ow meaning five) making everyone flustered as the pronunciation is too close to a Korean cuss word  They clarified the same amidst fits of laughter and disbelief  The first game&rsquo;s winner was Jimin, followed by the ranks in order: RM, Jin, J-Hope, V, Jungkook and SUGA, who came in last \n\nThe &lsquo;Liar&rsquo; game\n\nBTS played an upgraded version of the famed mafia game as they were divided into two teams in each round: the liar team and the citizens/villagers team  While they all tried their best to fool each other and find out who the actual liars are, it was only more apparent how well the BTS members knew each other and were accustomed to their presence  To add to the fun, each one of them was given electroencephalograph cat ears  As they lied or tried to be cheeky, the ears moved and made them look adorable  When a question about if they liked to take showers frequently or not was raised, they failed to lie and the liar team was found out easily  The next question was about them having fruity faces and though they faltered, it became a hilarious round of guessing who was which fruit  The last question was about dancing when sad and soon the fingers were pointed once again  In the end, the game came to a close with Jungkook being rightfully picked as the liar \n\nThe following week&rsquo;s episode was teased next with more fun games at the expense of the BTS members who are always ready to unleash their funny sides  After the group events, it is time for solo games that will earn the members more points and hopefully, a reward awaits them at the end \nnYyAQ_w0qGcAbout Run BTS\n\nThe famed variety show was begun by the South Korean septet in 2015  It did not gain the numbers it currently boasts right off the bat as it first started slowly with smaller episodes that introduced the group member&rsquo;s traits to the world  Over time, their charms had the fans hoodwinked, and as the global influence, as well as their amount of fans, grew, so did the interest in their non-music activities, with the primary focus on &lsquo;Run BTS&rsquo;  The show took a break of 10 months and returned late last year with special episodes released every few weeks to keep the momentum going \n\nStay updated with the latest Hallyu news on: Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and Snapcha\n',

 "Is BTS really on a hiatus? Well, hiatus or not, there's no dearth of content featuring the Bangtan Boys – RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook. We would be getting some amazing solo content from BTS members soon RM aka Kim Namjoon is the leader of BTS, Bangtan Sonyeodan. He has been in charge of keeping together the other six members and maintaining harmony and leading the pack. And while doing so, Joonie aka RM turned from Rap Moster to RM (Real Me), father-figure types. From Namjoon comforting a crying Taehyung to being concerned about Jungkook and Jimin sleeping on the floor. From giving piggyback rides to J-Hope to helping the eldest child - Jin - whenever he is stuck. From collecting the members for a hug to cheering on the members being cute and adorable. And also being strict with the boys when they get out of hand, especially the maknae line - Park Jimin aka Jimin, Kim Taehyung aka V and Jeon Jungkook aka Jungkook. Despite RM not being the eldest member, he has turned into someone the Bangtan Boys rely on and look up to on various things. RM lets the boys be themselves and accepts all their shenanigans like a resigned father. Well, it is very funny and goofy. Who knew RM's dream of being a dad would come true in this way? Teehee, just kidding Meanwhile, RM is not new to solo projects. He has dropped two mixtapes of his own RM (2015) and Mono (2018) which were widely acclaimed. Mono had peaked at 26 on Billboard 200 which was the highest-charting album by a Korean soloist in chart history. BTS RM aka Kim Namjoon has collaborated with various artists such as Wale, Younha, Warren G, Gaeko, Krizz Kaliko, MFBTY, Fall Out Boy, Primary, and Lil Nas X to name a few. He has a KOMCA credit score of 199. He is gearing up for his solo album next and hopes that he is the one to release his solo project after J-Hope",

 'In the clip, Suga said, "I picked two songs in completely contrasting styles. They’re Trivia: Seesaw, which is relatively calm and BTS Cypher PT.3: Killer (Feat. Supreme Boi) which is more powerful and full of energy. I wonder what sort of songs I can come up with ranging between these polar opposite songs. It’s fun and meaningful to come up with ideas for expanding my musical spectrum." "I think that always challenging myself with no limits in the musical spectrum is who I am and who BTS is. I guess my music and BTS’ music that are the products of these thoughts and ideas are our Proof," he concluded. In one segment of the video, Suga and RM were seen standing in front of mics as they seemingly performed with live musicians in a venue similar to a desert.

A fan tweeted, "Are they filming a music video at Lake Dolores Waterpark, an abandoned water park in California about 2 hours away from Las Vegas." A person wrote, "And they\'re using standing microphones. Can\'t imagine what is to come!!" A tweet read, "I continue to believe that this is footage from a new clip." "Feels like snaps from their new mv or maybe a teaser," guessed a fan. "I think they filmed something in a deserted area for the song Born Singer. They\'re all using standing microphones and I saw drums and live band sessions in the back. I\'m just guessing. Why today is not June 10th??" asked a fan. "Don\'t you guys think it\'s like....a new way to build up teasing (teaser) ???? Everyone is more and more curious now," wrote another fan. "I think there will be a video for born singer or this might be for one of the other new songs. Not yet to come or BTS run, but one of the other two," said a Twitter user. "A live band????" asked a person. "It looks like a performance video more than an mv film, tell us bestie @BTS_twt," wrote a person. "It’s either an mv or performance video," read a tweet. "I feel that the place is where RM took pics, 7 Magic mountains," guessed a fan. Recently, RM, Jin, Jimin, V and Jungkook shared their videos speaking about their \'Proof of Inspiration\'.

 "BTS members love their pets dearly. J-Hope is the proud owner of a Shih Tzu named Mickey. The little one is the darling of the Jung family. Some days back, J-Hope had told the BTS members that pets are love, but it hurts when they get old. Jung Hoseok said that their dog Mickey could not see now and it pained the whole family. Of late, he shared some pics with Mickey and his eyes looked a little different. Now, his sister Jiwoo wrote in her Insta stories that Mickey had glaucoma and was in a lot of pain. It seems they cried seeing their beloved pet lose his vision. Finally, they took a decision to get him operated. Now, their let manages to find his food and rest in his allotted space. Mickey is taken care of by J-Hope and Jiwoo's parents It seems Mickey was left at a gas station by an elderly couple 12 years ago. She said their daughter brought him home but had gone away. It has become tough for them to look after a young pup. J-Hope's mom and sister brought Mickey home and made him their pet. She said she could not help her parents in caring for Mickey as much as she did before as she was married now. But she said that the Jung family would collectively do everything to keep their 'youngest child' happy and healthy. ARMY had a meltdown reading her post. A fan wrote about how J-Hope always encourages adoption of pets. He apparently once paid for treatment of an injured stray cat BTS is now on a holiday. RM, V, Jungkook, SUGA, Jimin, Jin and J-Hope are spending time with their families after years. The last time they took a long break was in 2019. The septet is expected to be back with the Seoul concert. J-Hope's birthday is coming in some days. Fans are hoping for Hope World 2 soon",
 'During season three of BTS\' reality show Bon Voyage in 2018, group members travelled to Malta where they engaged in several activities. While walking around one evening, Jungkook came near a place where people were busking. As he looked around, a member of his crew asked if he wanted to sing too and he smiled expressing his wish. When Jin and J-Hope came to know about Jungkook, they ran to the area. As they rushed, Jin said, "He\'s different. The main vocalist of BTS is different." When they met Jungkook, J-Hope said, "We came here because we heard you\'re going to sing." As Jungkook sought suggestions, Jin and J-Hope bombarded him with songs such as Torri Kelly, Love You Hate You, Paper Heart, and La La Land. After much discussion, Jungkook said he would sing Adam Levine\'s Lost Stars. Walking up to the mic, Jungkook bowed and greeted the people, "Nice to meet you." He then spoke in Korean to Jin and J-Hope sitting nearby, "I drank a little." As J-Hope said, "You can do it. You will be fine. It\'s okay", he replied, "I don\'t care if I ruin it." Before starting the song he said his iconic line, "Let\'s get it" leaving Jin and J-Hope in splits. Watch video of Jungkook busking on Malta While Junkook sang, J-Hope recorded the video while the crowd listened to him. As he concluded the song and said, "Sorry, thank you", the crowd was heard hooting, screaming and clapping. When they made their way to the hotel, J-Hope told Jungkook, "All the people were singing along. Right, everyone next to us was singing along." Jungkook who was watching the recording on J-Hope\'s phone, returned it to him saying, "I\'m too embarrassed to watch it. I was off-tune. I messed the song up. I was all over the place tune-wise. Next time I\'ll be fully prepared." Jin and J-Hope cheered him up saying, "It was very beautiful. I feel like I\'m in love. No, you did well. You were in tune." In June, Jungkook collaborated with singer Charlie Puth on a new single Left and Right. BTS is currently on a break as a unit with the members pursuing solo projects.

 'A fan of Jazz music, V, aka Kim Taehyung, also teased that fans \'might be able to hear something jazzy\' from him soon. He said that he liked jazz ever since he was a schoolboy, but it’s something that he \'only admired from afar and never dared to do myself\'. He also said that he is \'intrigued\' by whatever ARMY finds interesting. V added that as ARMY has been talking about wanting to hear him on the radio, so he wants \'to try some deejaying\'. In an interview with Vogue Korea, V said, "There is a feeling of responsibility in whatever I do, but I don’t regret what I’ve done. I want to be a good person for those who love me. Our ARMY, BTS members, family and friends keep me happy and healthy even when I’m hurt and struggling. I cherish human connection. I am a people person and I truly enjoy working with everyone I cross professional paths with, including artists, directors, writers, and journalists like you. In the past, I used to be more reserved because I had been hurt by people who treated me simply as a valuable asset to know and not as a friend. But I still like people. It is thanks to the wonderful people in my life that I am who I am now." Speaking about the BTS members, V said, "We are a really positive group and all eager to unconditionally support each other. We had a meeting recently at Suga’s place to play the music we had been working on individually. We were dancing and praising each other non-stop. Being able to pursue one’s own music style lights the passion and enthusiasm in us. That’s what keeps us in love with what we do. I love seeing that." V will be seen next with the other BTS members at a concert in Busan in support of the city\'s bid to host the World Expo in 2030. The Yet To Come free concert will be held at 6 pm on October 15 at the Asiad Main Stadium. Earlier, it was scheduled to take place at Busan Ilgwang special stage in Gijang-gun.',

As translated by Twitter user @BTStranslation_, the letter read, "To, Hoseokie hyung (elder brother). Ah hyung. Since this is the first time I\'m writing a letter to a member, so it\'s a little awkward (laughs). I\'m dying of the cheesiness (laughs). I couldn\'t celebrate hyung\'s birthday last year as I wanted so it kept bothering me. But this time I wanted anything at all out of (what I wanted) so I\'ve tried preparing even if it\'s simple." "I\'m always thankful and please guide (us) the members well in the future too. Hyung probably also has a lot of worries and tough things but thank you for always working even harder than the members without showing it. It\'ll be hard in future too so please really take care of your body well. These days (your/our) body aches often too but... Anyway, and happy birthday from the bottom of my heart. In future too, I might upset you (sometimes) so please look after me well-! (very cutely) Love you! (very cutely) - dongsaeng (younger sibling) Jiminie," it read.s In the next Instagram Story, J-Hope tagged BTS members RM and Suga.

 'Earlier Jimin had shared a post, saying, "I made the title for Yoongi hyung\'s (elder brother) V Live." The title for Suga\'s Live was, \'My hair has grown a lot longer\'. When a fan teased Suga saying that he\'s getting younger, he laughed and said, "I\'m 30, I\'m not that old yet." Speaking about the original soundtrack, Stay Alive, that he produced for the webtoon 7 Fates Chakho, Suga asked the feedback of his viewers. As translated by Twitter user @BTStranslation_ Yoongi spoke about both the tracks--Stay Alive and Girl of My Dreams, revealing that he wrote the lyrics for the songs on the flight to the US. He also said he recorded Girl of My Dreams almost as soon as he landed there. Suga then spoke about the lyrics of Stay Alive and also about Jungkook who sang the song. "I wrote the lyrics for Stay Alive with keeping the webtoon in mind. Jungkook recorded the song so well. The chorus was so high but he didn\'t even do a re-recording, it was approved at once. He\'s a person overflowing with talent." When a fan asked if Suga was working on Stay Alive in In The Soop, he replied, "Yes right. But at the time Jungkook\'s melody was not put in the song. It\'s the one I was working on in In The Soop." Suga also promised ARMY that he will hold a live session on his birthday, which is on March 9. "It\'s my birthday soon, I\'ll see you guys on my birthday. I\'ll come live again on my birthday," he said. When asked what he planned to do on his special day, Suga replied, "What will I do on my birthday? The day after is concert day so I don\'t think I can do much (laughed)." BTS will hold three concerts in Seoul this month. The BTS Permission To Dance On Stage-Seoul is scheduled on March 10, 12 and 13. The BTS member also spoke about their home concert next week, "The concert is going to be very fun. We\'re preparing hard. We\'ve been looking forward to a concert in Korea. It will still be quite chilly in March so I\'m trying not to get sick." About their Las Vegas concert, Suga said, "I\'m excited for the Vegas concert too, the renewed venue. The stadium itself looked so cool, we saw it while passing by." The dates of the concerts are April 8, 9, 15 and 16. When a fan teased him saying Bangtan (BTS) is so lucky they can go to Bangtan concert, Suga laughed and said, "Haha, they (we) go every time." A fan wrote, "If I can\'t go to the concert I\'ll die", Suga responded laughing, "It\'s not like that. You can watch it online too." When he asked ARMY to not get \'too nervous\' during ticketing and be calm, a fan said, "Is there a way not to get nervous (about ticketing)?" He replied, "Just do it as you normally would. Like when you\'re choosing from a menu." The BTS members--RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook last December debuted on Instagram. Speaking about his feed, Suga said, "I don\'t know what pictures to upload on Instagram. I don\'t know how to make my feed look pretty, either. I normally don\'t take pictures. I\'m still not sure what this \'Instagram vibe\' is all about." Suga who recently recovered from Covid-19, said, "My condition is all better now. It\'s been like three months since I contracted it (Covid-19). People don\'t always catch it cause they didn\'t take care. No one wants to contract it on purpose. It\'s not your fault." Suga also replied when asked if his pet Holly still walks all over him, "Yes. When I get home he comes with his clothes held in his mouth like let\'s go on a walk. He\'s sleeping right next to me every day."',

 "BLACKPINK members are now busy promoting their album Pink Venom. They are in the US. The girls went on the Jimmy Kimmel show where they did a live performance of the song. It seems Rose outdid herself with her moves and amazing vocals. Now, the host said that 'kids' were super excited to see BLACKPINK on the Kimmel stage. This has not gone down well with K-Pop fans. It is a known fact that the popular groups have fans across age groups and ethnicities. Some time back, James Corden referred to BTS fans as 15-year-old fangirls and ARMY did not take it lightly at all. In fact, the host apologized to RM aka Kim Namjoon when they came on the show during the LA Concert promotions Now, Kim Jisoo had to miss the 2022 Seoul Drama Awards to be present for the promotions of Pink Venom. She was awarded the Best Actress for Snowdrop. Blinks and solo fans of Jisoo are upset that she had to miss out because of Jimmy Kimmel. Some have even termed the performance as boring. They feel YG Entertainment should have done better with the promotions of Pink Venom. Snowdrop saw a heartfelt performance from Kim Jisoo. This was her acting debut Jisoo's vocals have also got praise in the Blackpink comeback. The singer is seen as the eldest sister of the group, and has been their emotional anchor. Kim Jisoo won at the fan voted event. Even Kim Seon-Ho who is world famous for his poignant acting in Hometown Cha Cha won an award",

 'The video started with Suga practising the choreography of That That. After teaching the rapper a few steps, the choreographers said that he \'learns fast\'. Suga laughed and said, "Then we can work on the details. I\'m not too confident. I just memorise quickly." After learning some more dance steps, Suga said laughing, "I knew it. I knew it wouldn\'t be easy. I was practising for the concert." At one point during their practice, Suga got curious and asked the choreographer, "Are you a leftie? We normally start with the right hand. You started everything with the left hand. So I thought you were a leftie." As the video continued, Suga practised and said, "If I think about something else for a moment. I miss it." One of the choreographers again told Suga that \'he\'s learning fast\'.

 "BTS and tales of their sasaeng fans are well-known. Now, one incident has been reported where a former sasaeng fan of the septet from Japan revealed how her obsession affected her life. It seems she was recruited by a Korean sasaeng who had told her to follow the band, and find out if Jungkook was dating someone or not. Koreaboo has revealed an incident which has been narrated on a YouTube channel Kisses Dahlia. A Japanese fan has said that she became a K-Pop fan in 2017, and BTS was her fave It seems she became famous because of the high quality pics that she took when she went to their concerts. This led to her being approached by a Korean sasaeng. She was given a 'job' to spy on the boys and take their pics. It seems she took up the offer because she needed the money. However, the sasaeng culture is very exhausting and found it worrying when she started enjoying the act of spying on the boys. The fan has said that her sister found out that she is a sasaeng and sent her for therapy. The girl has said that she is regretful of her actions and understands how sasaeng culture is harmful Even today Jimin said that some fans were calling him when he was doing his VLive with J-Hope after the Lollapalooza Festival. Fans wondered if they were sasaengs who were troubling the boys. We also remember how Jungkook kept getting calls in the middle of the night as he did a VLive chat during the Las Vegas tour. Sasaengs have been known to book tickets in same flights as the boys due to which they stopped taking commercial flights. Once, a sasaeng tried to kiss SUGA but was held by the bodyguard",
 "One of the attention-grabbing things in BTS ARMY and Blink's life is the dating rumour between Kim Taehyung and Jennie Kim. It doesn't seem to die down and the fandoms have been arguing forever now! Both the artists BTS V and Jennie have kept mum and their dating rumours. Talking about the dating rumours, every day there are images surfacing, going viral and circulated online, claiming to be leaked images as proof of Taehyung and Jennie's relationship. There has been no confirmation about the same, but the one leaking the images claims that everything is real. An HD pic seems to have surfaced now So, yesterday, V aka Kim Taehyung shared a video with Yeontan. It was a cute and the most adorable video wherein BTS V made Yeontan play with him before giving him his treat. After the video was shared, an old picture shared by Gurumi Haribo resurfaced and allegedly in an HD format. The picture is cut at the upper side where Jennie's picture is seen. The picture claims to be a video call between the two artists ARMYs and Blinks have previously called out the pictures as fake and edited. Even before the pics have been called out as fake wherein the ARMYs dissected the editing skills of the photo editor and the one who leaked them. And now, they have again slammed the edited picture saying that the whole door has been edited out in the new image It’s been weeks since Kim Taehyung and Jennie have been linked together. Earlier the agencies YG Entertainment and HYBE aka Big Hit released vague statements about edited pictures without addressing the alleged affair. BTS V's pet pooch, Yeontan, has been dragged into their rumoured affair previously. A picture alleged to be clicked by Jennie was shared stating that she clicked the picture of Yeontan",
 'At the concert, fans were seen holding placards that read, "We want to focus on..." next to a picture of Jungkook raising his iconic black blazer flashing his abs. Jungkook lifted his T-shirt and showed off his abs. As ARMY cheered, Jungkook was seen laughing and giggling. BTS member Jimin was seen in a black jacket and pants. He opted not to wear the jacket and wore a chain around his neck. For the concert, Jimin opted to appear with short hair. He was seen with long hair in his last concerts. At the concert, RM said, "I know there\'s a lot of noise out there about the Grammys, but you know, why give a s*** about it? Hating is their freedom, and they have their right to hate, but if it was me, I\'d rather just talk with my friends in some cafe and then forget about it. Rather than tweeting about it or some interview. I won\'t do that because I\'m a grown up. But anyway, we didn\'t come to Vegas for the Grammys, we came to Vegas for the ARMYs!" He also said, "The records, the titles, the accomplishments, the trophies, they\'re really important, but that wasn\'t the first thing, the first reason why we started all these things. These two hours communion, energy, eye to eye, singing along, dancing together, this communication, this is everything. This is why we\'re doing this right? I hope you know it. I love you. Let the haters hate, let the lovers love. Peace!" J-Hope, as translated by Twitter user @jhopestudio, said, "There’s nothing holding us back, no one can stop us now." At the start of the BTS concert, the show was delayed due to technical difficulties. Speaking about it, V said, "We had trouble with the screen earlier and I was thinking \'ahh s***** (expletive in Korean)\'.” While translating, the translator said, "We had trouble with the screen earlier and I was thinking \'oh shoot\'." V quickly corrected him, "It’s not ‘shoot\' though.” The translator said "s***”. BTS members will hold three more concerts at the same venue. They will perform on April 9, April 15, and April 16.',
